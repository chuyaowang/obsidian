## A Note on this Vault

The notes here are interconnected and in a constant state of flux. Some are well-formed articles, while others are fleeting thoughts or rough drafts. 📝

I also maintain a collection of notes from papers I've read and presentations I've attended. For some of these, I provide a rubric and have an AI assistant help fill in the details. 🤖✍️

**Disclaimer:** Some content in this vault is AI-generated based on my original notes and then reviewed by me. I strive for accuracy, but please use your own judgment.

Feel free to explore, but please keep in mind that this is a personal sense-making space.
