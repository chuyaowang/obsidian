# Writing JS Scripts

## JS Code Conventions

- JavaScript statements are composed of: Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments;
- JS statements must be separated by semicolons. When separated by semicolons, multiple statements can be written on one line, like:
``` js
a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;
```
- JS ignores whitespaces, so `a=5` and `a = 5` are equivalent;
- A long line can be broken at operators, like:
``` js
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =  
"Hello Dolly!";
```

## JS Codeblocks

Codeblocks are grouped together by {}. The statements inside are executed together.
``` js
function myFunction() {  
  document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";  
  document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";  
}
```
