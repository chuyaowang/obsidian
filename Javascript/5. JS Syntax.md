# JS Syntax

> [JS](JS.md)

## Value Types

^c54522

- Fixed values: called **literals**
- Variable values: called **variables**

## Literals

- Numbers are written with or without decimals
- Strings are text within double or single quotes

## Create variables

Use `let`, `var`, and `const` to declare variables. Then assign value to the variable with `=`

``` js
let x, y;
x = 6;
y = 5;
```

## JS Expressions

Expressions are combination of operators, variables, and values to compute values. Expressions also apply to strings.

``` js
"John" + " " + "Doe"
```
Evaluates to 'John Doe'

## JS Comments

``` js
// Comments are preceded by double slashes
/* or between these signs */
```

## JS Identifiers

Identifiers are used to name variables, [keywords](4.%20JS%20Statements.md#JS%20Keywords), and functions. They cannot begin with a number, and cannot contain hyphens. ^23c4e7
