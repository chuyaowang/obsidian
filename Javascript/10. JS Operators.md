## Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Description                                                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| +        | Addition                                                            |
| -        | Subtraction                                                         |
| *        | Multiplication                                                      |
| **       | Exponentiation ([ES2016](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_2016.asp)) |
| /        | Division                                                            |
| %        | Modulus (Division Remainder)                                        |
| ++       | Increment                                                           |
| --       | Decrement                                                           |

## Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| =        | x = y   | x = y      |
| +=       | x += y  | x = x + y  |
| -=       | x -= y  | x = x - y  |
| *=       | x *= y  | x = x * y  |
| /=       | x /= y  | x = x / y  |
| %=       | x %= y  | x = x % y  |
| **=      | x **= y | x = x ** y |

## Comparison Operators

| Operator | Description                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| ==      | equal to                          |
| ===    | equal value and equal type        |
| !=       | not equal                         |
| !==     | not equal value or not equal type |
| >        | greater than                      |
| <        | less than                         |
| >=       | greater than or equal to          |
| <=       | less than or equal to             |
| ?        | ternary operator                  |

### String Comparison

Comparison operators work with strings as well. The strings are compared alphabetically.

``` js
let text1 = "A";  
let text2 = "B";  
let result = text1 < text2;
// It would return true because A is before B in the alphabet.
```

``` js
let text1 = "20";  
let text2 = "5";  
let result = text1 < text2;
// This would also return true because 2 is before 5. They are treated like letters
```

### String Addition

``` js
// Strings can be added with strings or numbers. Adding strings with numbers always result in strings.

let text1 = "John";  
let text2 = "Doe";  
let text3 = text1 + " " + text2;
// Result in "John Doe"

let text1 = "What a very ";  
text1 += "nice day";
// Result in "What a very nice day"

let x = 5 + 5;  
let y = "5" + 5;  
let z = "Hello" + 5;
/*
x = 10
y = "55"
z = "Hello5"
*/
```

### Ternary Operator

A short way to write a if-else statement.

``` js
let result = (10 > 0) ? "true statement" : "false statement";
// result = "true statement"
```

3 components: a condition, a trueExpression, a falseExpression

```
condition ? trueExpression : falseExpression
```

## JS Logical Operators

| Operator | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| &&       | logical and |
| \|\|       | logical or  |
| !        | logical not |

## JS Type Operators

| Operator   | Description                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| typeof     | Returns the type of a variable                             |
| instanceof | Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type |

## JS Bitwise Operators

> [!note] Bitwise Operation
> Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers.
> 
> Any numeric operand in the operation is converted into a 32 bit number. The result is converted back to a JavaScript number.

| Operator | Description          | Example | Same as      | Result | Decimal |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------ | ------ | ------- |
| &        | AND                  | 5 & 1   | 0101 & 0001  | 0001   | 1       |
| \|       | OR                   | 5 \| 1  | 0101 \| 0001 | 0101   | 5       |
| ~        | NOT                  | ~ 5     | ~0101        | 1010   | 10      |
| ^        | XOR                  | 5 ^ 1   | 0101 ^ 0001  | 0100   | 4       |
| <<       | left shift           | 5 << 1  | 0101 << 1    | 1010   | 10      |
| >>       | right shift          | 5 >> 1  | 0101 >> 1    | 0010   | 2       |
| >>>      | unsigned right shift | 5 >>> 1 | 0101 >>> 1   | 0010   | 2       |

> [!info]
> The examples above uses 4 bits unsigned examples. But JavaScript uses 32-bit signed numbers.  
> Because of this, in JavaScript, ~ 5 will not return 10. It will return -6.  
> ~00000000000000000000000000000101 will return 11111111111111111111111111111010

> Bitwise operators are fully described in the [**JS Bitwise**](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_bitwise.asp) chapter.
> 
> Bitwise operations only work reliably on numbers that can be expressed as 32-bit sequences. Any numbers above 2147483647 or below -2147483648 will not work as you expect.
