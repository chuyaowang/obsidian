## Block Scope

Before ES6 (2015), JS had global and function scopes. The introduction of `let` and `const` brought **block scope**.

Block scope means the variables defined within a code block cannot be accessed outside the code block.

``` js
{
let x = "I cannot be accessed outside this code block";
}
// can't use x here
```

## Global Scope

Variables defined with `var` always have **global scope** and cannot have **block scope**

``` js
{
var x = "I can be accessed outside this code block";
}
// can still use x here
```

## Let cannot be redeclared

``` js
// This cannot happen
let x = 5;
let x;

// But this can
var y = 6;
var y;
```

``` js
var x = 2;   // Allowed, x is 2
var x = 4;   // Allowed, x is 3 now
let x = 3;   // Not allowed, x is in the same scope
  
{  
let x = 2;   // Allowed  
let x = 3;   // Not allowed, x is in the same scope
}  
  
{  
let x = 2;   // Allowed  
var x = 3;   // Not allowed, x is declared with let
}
```

## Redeclaring in different scopes

Redeclaring with `var`

``` js
var x = 6;
// Here x is 6, x is a global variable

{
var x = 7;
// Here x is 7, x is still a global variable
}

// Here x is 7
```

Redeclaring with `let`

``` js
let x = 6;
// Here x is 6, a global variable

{
let x = 4;
// Here x is 4, a new block variable
}

// Here x is 6, still the original global variable
```

## Let hoisting

Variables defined with `var` is hoisted at the top and can be initialized at any time, meaning it can be used before it is declared.

Variables defined with `let` are also hoisted at the top but not initialized, meaning it must be declared before it is used.

``` js
// Allowed
x = 5;
var x;

// Not allowed, result in a ReferenceError
x = 5;
let x;
```

## Comparing let, var, and const

| Scope | Redeclare | Reassign | Hoisted | Binds this |     |
| ----- | --------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | --- |
| var   | No        | Yes      | Yes     | Yes        | Yes |
| let   | Yes       | No       | Yes     | No         | No  |
| const | Yes       | No       | No      | No         | No  |

## What is Good?

`let` and `const` have **block scope**.

`let` and `const` can not be **redeclared**.

`let` and `const` must be **declared** before use.

`let` and `const` does **not bind** to `this`.

`let` and `const` are **not hoisted**.

## What is Not Good?

`var` does not have to be declared.

`var` is hoisted.

`var` binds to this.
