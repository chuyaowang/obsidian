## Operators

### Assignment Operators

|Operator|Example|Same As|
|---|---|---|
|=|x = y|x = y|
|+=|x += y|x = x + y|
|-=|x -= y|x = x - y|
|*=|x *= y|x = x * y|
|/=|x /= y|x = x / y|
|%=|x %= y|x = x % y|
|**=|x **= y|x = x ** y|

### Shift Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example  | Same As     |
| -------- | -------- | ----------- |
| <<=      | x <<= y  | x = x << y  |
| >>=      | x >>= y  | x = x >> y  |
| >>>=     | x >>>= y | x = x >>> y |

### Bitwise Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Same As    |
| -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| &=       | x &= y  | x = x & y  |
| ^=       | x ^= y  | x = x ^ y  |
| \|=      | x \|= y | x = x \| y |

### Logical Assignment Operators

| Operator | Example | Same As          |
| -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| &&=      | x &&= y | x = x && (x = y) |
| \|\|=      | x \|\|= y | x = x \|\| (x = y) |
| ??=      | x ??= y | x = x ?? (x = y) |

## Bitwise Assignment Operators

### Left Shift Assignment

``` js
let x = -100;  
x <<= 5;
/*
The 32 bit signed binary of -100 is 11111111 11111111 11111111 10011100
Shift it to the left by 5 places, and fill in the blanks with 0s to get
x = -3200
*/
```

### Signed Right Shift Assignment

``` js
let x = -100;  
x >>= 5;
/*
The 32 bit signed binary of -100 is 11111111 11111111 11111111 10011100
Shift it to the right by 5 places, and fill in the blanks with the leftmost bit (1) to get
x = -4
*/
```

### Unsigned Right Shift Assignment

``` js
let x = -100;  
x >>>= 5;
/*
The 32 bit signed binary of -100 is 11111111 11111111 11111111 10011100
Shift it to the right by 5 places, and fill in the blanks with 0s to get
x = 134217727
*/
```

> [!note]
> For signed binary numbers, 0 at the leftmost bit means the number is positive, and 1 means the number is negative.
> 
> When `>>>` is used, the number after shifting is always positive, since 0s are used to fill in the blanks. Hence, unsigned right shift is often used to ensure the number is non-negative.
> 
> ``` js
> let x = -100;
> x >>>=0
> // x is 4294967195
> ```
> 
> When `>>` is used, the original sign is preserved. Hence, signed right shift is often used to ensure the number is an integer.
> 
> ``` js
> let x = -101.44;
> x >>= 0;
> // x is -101

### The Bitwise AND Assignment operator

The **Bitwise AND Assignment Operator** does a bitwise AND operation on two operands and assigns the result to the the variable.

``` js
let x = 10;  
x &= 5;
```

### The Bitwise OR Assignment Operator

The **Bitwise OR Assignment Operator** does a bitwise OR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

``` js
let x = 10;  
x |= 5;
```

### The Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator

The **Bitwise XOR Assignment Operator** does a bitwise XOR operation on two operands and assigns the result to the variable.

``` js
let x = 10;  
x ^= 5;
```

## Logical Assignment Operators

### Logical AND Assignment Operator

The **Logical AND assignment operator** is used between two values.

If the first value is true, the second value is assigned.

If the first value is false, the first value is assigned.

``` js
let x = 10;  
x &&= 5;
// x = 5
```

### Logical OR Assignment Operator

The **Logical OR assignment operator** is used between two values.

If the first value is false, the second value is assigned.

If the first value is true, the first value is assigned.

``` js
let x = 10;  
x ||= 5;
// x = 10
```

### Nullish Coalescing Assignment Operator

The **Nullish coalescing assignment operator** is used between two values.

If the first value is undefined or null, the second value is assigned.

If the first value has a value, the first value is assigned.

``` js
let x;
x ??= 5;
```
