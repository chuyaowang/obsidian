# Where to Place Code

> [JS](JS.md)

## The \<script> tag

JS code is placed between the \<script><\/script> tags

``` html
<script>  
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "My First JavaScript";  
</script>
```

This code sets the text for the element with id = "demo"

## JS Functions and Events

A JS function is a block of JS code that is executed when called or triggered by an event, such as button click.

## JS in \<head> or \<body>

JS can be placed in both sections. There is no number limit

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<head>  
<script>  
function myFunction() {  
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";  
}  
</script>  
</head>  
<body>

<h2>Demo JavaScript in Head</h2>  
  
<p id="demo">A Paragraph</p>  
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

</body>  
</html>
```

A function called `myFunction` is defined in the head section. It is then called by a **button click event** as `onclick="myFunction()`

It can be placed in the body as well. Scripts do not have to precede the element that uses it. 

It is good practice to place scripts **at the bottom**, as script interpretation slows down display speed.

## External Scripts

Common scripts that are reused can be placed in an individual file and called.

Create a file called myScript.js and save this function.

``` js
function myFunction() {  
  document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed.";  
}
```

In HTML, source this script by

``` HTML
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
```

Then use `myFunction()` by

``` html
<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
```

> [!warning]
> 
> External scripts cannot contain the \<script> tag.

> [!note] Advantages of external scripts
> 
> - It separates HTML and code
> - It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
> - Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

## Reference external scripts

It is good practice to use a **relative path**.

``` html
<script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>
```
