# Display JS Output

> [JS](JS.md)

## JS Display Possibilities

- Writing into an HTML element, using `innerHTML`.
- Writing into the HTML output using `document.write()`.
- Writing into an alert box, using `window.alert()`.
- Writing into the browser console, using `console.log()`.

## Using innerHTML

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>  
<p>My First Paragraph</p>  
  
<p id="demo"></p>  
  
<script>  
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

Result of 5+6 is evaluated and displayed in the paragraph whose id is "demo"

## Using document.write()

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>  
<p>My first paragraph.</p>  
  
<script>  
document.write(5 + 6);  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

The result of 5+6, 11, will be written to the webpage.

> [!warning]
> 
> Calling document.write() after the whole page is loaded will delete all existing html!
> document.write() should only be used for testing purposes.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>My First Web Page</h2>
<p>My first paragraph.</p>

<script>  
function myFunction() {  
  document.write(5 + 6);  
}  
</script> 

<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>

</body>
</html> 
```

Clicking on the button will remove everything and write 11 to the page.

> JS code should end with a `;`

## Using window.alert()

You can use an alert box to display output

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<h1>My First Web Page</h1>  
<p>My first paragraph.</p>  
  
<script>  
window.alert(5 + 6);  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

A window will pop up displaying 11.

> [!note]
> 
> In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the `window` keyword is optional.
> 
> i.e. this works as well: 
> ``` js
> alert(5 + 6);
> ```

## Using console.log()

Used for debugging. 

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<script>  
console.log(5 + 6);  
</script>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

This will print 11 in the console.

## Print

> [!note]
> 
> JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
> 
> You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
> 
> The only exception is that you can call the `window.print()` method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
<body>  
  
<button onclick="window.print()">Print this page</button>  
  
</body>  
</html>
```

This will print the whole page.

> [!info] Output Devices
> In the context provided, "output devices" typically refers to hardware devices such as printers, screens, speakers, etc., that are used to display or render output to the user.
> 
> The statement "JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods" is accurate. Unlike some other programming languages (such as [Python](Python.md), which has a `print()` function), JavaScript itself doesn't have built-in methods specifically for sending output directly to printers or other physical output devices.
> 
> Similarly, the statement "You cannot access output devices from JavaScript" is generally true. JavaScript, when running in a browser environment (which is the most common context), is sandboxed for security reasons. It does not have direct access to hardware devices like printers or speakers for security reasons. JavaScript primarily interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) and other browser APIs to manipulate web pages and handle user interactions.
> 
> However, JavaScript can interact with output devices indirectly. For example, JavaScript running in a web browser can generate content dynamically and present it on the screen, which users can then print using browser functionality. JavaScript can also interact with server-side scripts that may have access to hardware devices or systems for printing or other output. Additionally, in certain specialized environments (such as Node.js applications running on servers), JavaScript may have more direct access to hardware, depending on the specific capabilities and permissions of the environment in which it's running.
