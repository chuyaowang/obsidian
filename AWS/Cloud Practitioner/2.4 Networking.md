## Introduction

> [!note] AWS Virtual Private Cloud
> 
> A VPC creates a boundary around your AWS resources. It lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a **virtual network** that you define. These resources can be **public** facing so they have access to the internet, or **private** with no internet access, usually for *backend* services like *databases* or *application servers*. The public and private grouping of resources are known as [subnets](#^1f4c8d) and they are ranges of IP addresses in your VPC.

## Connectivity to AWS

> [!summary] Subnets
> 
> Subnets are part of [VPCs](2.4%20Networking.md#^fd5b06) and can contain resources such as EC2 instances. There are public subnets and private subnets.

^1f4c8d

> [!note] Gateways
> 
> Gateways allow internet or network traffic to enter a VPC and access subnets. A VPC can have multiple types of gateways attached for multiple types of resources within the same VPC, just in different subnets.

^9d6b92

> [!summary] Internet Gateway (IGW)
> 
> An internet [gateway](2.4%20Networking.md#^9d6b92) allows **public** traffic from the internet to access the [VPC](2.4%20Networking.md#^fd5b06). Public [subnets](2.4%20Networking.md#^1f4c8d) have access to the IGW.

> [!summary] Virtual Private Gateway
> 
> A virtual private [gateway](2.4%20Networking.md#^9d6b92) allows only traffic from an **approved network** to enter the [VPC](2.4%20Networking.md#^fd5b06). This can be a on-premise data center or a corporate internal network. Private [subnets](2.4%20Networking.md#^1f4c8d) have access to the private gateway. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) must be established between the network and the VPC. The network traffic is encrypted.

> [!note] AWS Direct Connect
> 
> A direct physical connection between your data center and the VPC offering the highest speed and security. This must be established with a Direct Connect partner in the region.

^43244c

> [!note] AWS Site-to-Site VPN
> Site-to-Site VPN creates an encrypted network path between your on-premises network and your AWS Cloud network. This connection between your on-premises network and your AWS Cloud network uses the internet.
> 
> This connection uses the internet, so you cannot expect consistency. Even though the traffic is encrypted, the connection is not private because the internet is a shared resource.

> [!note] AWS Client VPN
> Client VPN is a managed client-based VPN service that gives you the ability to securely access your AWS resources and the resources in your on-premises network. With Client VPN, you can access your resources from any location through an OpenVPN-based VPN client.

> [!note] AWS Transit Gateway
> AWS Transit Gateway connects your [Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)](#^fd5b06) and on-premises networks through a central hub. This connection simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. Transit Gateway acts as a highly scalable cloud router—each new connection is made only once.

> [!note] VPC Endpoints
> [VPC](#^fd5b06) endpoints enable private connectivity between your VPC and supported AWS services.

> [!note] AWS PrivateLink
> AWS PrivateLink establishes connectivity between VPCs and AWS services without exposing data to the internet

## Subnets and Network Access Control List

> [!summary] Packet
> 
> A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network. Packets can be sent among [subnets](2.4%20Networking.md#^1f4c8d) in a [VPC](2.4%20Networking.md#^fd5b06).

^9bc669

> [!summary] Network Access Control List
> 
> Network ACLs control whether a [packet](2.4%20Networking.md#^9bc669) enters or leaves a [subnet](2.4%20Networking.md#^1f4c8d) after it enters via a [gateway](2.4%20Networking.md#^9d6b92). Network ACLs are **stateless**, meaning they do not remember previous requests to enter or leave. 

^6a7e64

> [!note] Custom Network ACLs
> 
> [Network ACLs](2.4%20Networking.md#^6a7e64) by default **allows** all inbound and outbound traffic. 
> 
> When custom network ACLs are added, all inbound and outbound traffic is **denied** until you add rules to specify which traffic to **allow**. 
> 
> Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit **deny rule**. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied.

> [!summary] Security Groups
> 
> Security groups manages [packet](2.4%20Networking.md#^9bc669) entry and leaving of [instances](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^d12940) after it enters a [subnet](2.4%20Networking.md#^1f4c8d). Security groups are **stateful**, meaning they remember decisions made for a request. For example, if the response for a packet sent out from the instance returns, the response is allowed in regardless of entry rules.

^cfee70

> [!note] Custom Security Groups
> 
> By default, a [security group](2.4%20Networking.md#^cfee70) **denies** all inbound traffic and **allows** all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic should be allowed; any other traffic would then be denied.
> 
> Multiple instances can share a security group, or each have their own security groups.

## Global Networking

> [!note] DNS Routing Policies
> 
> [AWS Route 53](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^165290) is AWS's domain name service. It translates web addresses to IP addresses. There are several routing policies, such as **latency-based routing**, **geolocation DNS**, **geoproximity**, and **weighted round robin**.
> 
> Geoproximity routing, for example, routes the request to the nearest server.

^189bae

> [!note] AWS Global Networking
> The AWS global networking structure is facilitated through the [AWS CloudFront](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^6894c0) and the [AWS Route 53](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^165290), supported by its [different routing policies](2.4%20Networking.md#^189bae).
> 
> CloudFront serves static content to users using edge locations, while Route 53 provides DNS and optimizes where requests are sent to.

> [!note] AWS Global Accelerator
> Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the performance of your users’ network traffic by up to 60%. Global Accelerator uses the AWS global network infrastructure.
> 
> A service that uses static IP addresses to route traffic over the AWS global network to optimal AWS endpoints based on health, geography, and routing policies. It provides highly available and performant applications with features like fast failover for multi-Region and Multi-AZ (Availability Zone) architectures.
