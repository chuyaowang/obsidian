## Introduction

> [!note] AWS Virtual Private Cloud
> 
> A VPC creates a boundary around your AWS resources. It lets you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a **virtual network** that you define. These resources can be **public** facing so they have access to the internet, or **private** with no internet access, usually for *backend* services like *databases* or *application servers*. The public and private grouping of resources are known as **subnets** and they are ranges of IP addresses in your VPC.
