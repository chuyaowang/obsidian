## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

> [!note] Shared Responsibility Model
> AWS is responsible for the security of the hardware, while the users are responsible for the security of the operation system and data.

## User Permission and Access

> [!note] AWS Identity and Access Management
> AWS IAM is a system that enables managing access to AWS resources and services.

^0b5c77

> [!summary] Root User
> A root user is the default user when an AWS account is created. It has complete access to everything under this account.

> [!info] Best Practices
> Do **not** use the root user for everyday tasks, and turn on multi-factor authentication for it.
> 
> Instead, use the root user to create your first [IAM user](#^8ee5e5) and assign it permissions to create other users.
> 
> Then, continue to create other IAM users, and access those identities for performing regular tasks throughout AWS. Only use the root user when you need to perform a limited number of tasks that are only available to the root user. Examples of these tasks include changing your root user email address and changing your AWS support plan. See “Tasks that require root user credentials” in the [AWS Account Management Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/root-user-tasks.html).

> [!note] IAM User
> [IAM](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^0b5c77)  users are identities created for people or applications that interacts with AWS services and resources. A user consists of a name and credentials.
> 
> A new user by default has no permission. The permissions must be explicitly given.

^8ee5e5

> [!info] Best Practices
> We recommend that you create individual IAM users for each person who needs to access AWS.  
> 
> Even if you have multiple employees who require the same level of access, you should create individual IAM users for each of them. This provides additional security by allowing each IAM user to have a unique set of security credentials.

> [!note] IAM Policy
> An [IAM](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^0b5c77) policy is a document that grants or denies permissions to an [IAM user](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^8ee5e5). The policies are attached to users to manage their permissions.
> 
> The components:
> - Effect: Allow or Deny
> - Action: an API call
> - Resource: the resource for the API call
> 
> Example:
> ``` json
> {
> 	"Version": "2012-10-17",
> 	"Statement": {
> 	"Effect": "Allow",
> 	"Action": "s3:ListBucket",
> 	"Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::AWSDOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET"
> 	}
> }
> ```

^bd05d6

> [!info] Best Practices
> The principle of least privilege: do not give anyone more permission than they need.

> [!note] IAM Groups
> IAM groups are groups of [IAM users](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^8ee5e5) that receive the same permissions. [IAM policies](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^bd05d6) attached to the group are applied to all the members within the group

> [!note] IAM Roles
> IAM roles are ideal for granting temporary accesses. Permissions must be given to a [IAM user](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^8ee5e5), an app, or a service to switch to a role. When they assumes a role, it no longer has the permissions of its previous role.

^f3ac1d

> [!info] Best Practices
> [IAM roles](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^f3ac1d) are ideal for situations in which access to services or resources needs to be granted temporarily, instead of long-term.

> [!info] Roles Instead of Users
> You can actually avoid creating [IAM users](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^8ee5e5) for every person in your organization by federating users into your account. This means that they could use their regular corporate credentials to log into AWS by mapping their corporate identities to [IAM roles](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^f3ac1d). 

^f551e4

> [!note] Multi-factor Authentication
> MFA can be set for the root and other users. This will require additional forms of authentication besides the user name and password.

> [!note] IAM Access Analyzer
> Analyzes [IAM policies](#^bd05d6) to identify potential issues and excessive permissions

> [!note] IAM Credential Report
> This built-in [IAM](#^0b5c77) feature provides detailed information about the rotation history of user passwords and access keys within the account. It shows dates of last password and access key rotation, along with usernames and key IDs.

> [!note] Amazon Security Token Service
> AWS STS enables you to request temporary credentials with a specific set of permissions (via [roles](#^f3ac1d)), which can be used to authenticate with other AWS services. This is commonly used for scenarios where you need to grant temporary access to resources without exposing long-term credentials.

> [!note] IAM Instance Profiles
> IAM instance profiles are used for providing [IAM roles](#^f3ac1d) to EC2 instances.

## AWS Organizations

> [!note] AWS Organization
> AWS Organizations provides a central place for managing multiple AWS accounts. 
> 
> A root, which is a parent container for all the accounts in your organization, is created when an organization is created.
> 
> Another advantage of organization is consolidated billing. The primary account can pay this bills for all the accounts within the organization, meaning more discounts.

^8ab2cb

> [!info] Free to Use
> [AWS Organization](#^8ab2cb) is free to use.

> [!note] Service Control Policies
> SCPs are used to grant permissions to users and roles under each account within the [organization](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^8ab2cb).

^92b45d

> [!note] Organizational Units
> OUs are groups of AWS accounts within an organization. [SCPs](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^92b45d) can be applied to OUs, which grant the same permissions to all the members.

> [!info] Multiple Policies
> [SCPs](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^92b45d) and [IAM polices](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^bd05d6) can work at the same time. SCPs take a higher precedence. There are other permission policies managing permissions, such as session policies and resource-based policies.

## Compliance

> [!note] AWS Artifact
> AWS Artifact is a service that provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports and select online agreements. AWS Artifact consists of two main sections: AWS Artifact Agreements and AWS Artifact Reports.
> - AWS Artifact Agreements: sign an agreement with AWS regarding your use of certain types of information throughout AWS services;
> - AWS Artifact Reports: compliance reports from third-party auditors.

> [!note] AWS Compliance Center
> Check out the AWS Compliance Center in order to find compliance information all in one place. It will show you compliance enabling services as well as documentation like the AWS Risk and Security Whitepaper, which you should read to ensure that you understand security and compliance with AWS.

> [!note] AWS Audit Manager
> Helps you continuously audit your AWS usage to simplify how you assess risk and compliance with regulations and industry standards

## Denial-of-Service Attacks

> [!summary] Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack
> DDoS attacks are performed by using multiple bots to send requests to the app server in order to overwhelm its capacity, such that normal users cannot get their access.

^b17521

> [!info] UDP Flood
> UDP flood asks a third party service, like the national weather service, to send data to your server. The large amount of incoming data will occupy the processing power of your server. It is considered a low-level network attack.
> 
> Solution: employ [security groups](2.4%20Networking.md#^cfee70) to block unsolicited data. Furthermore, security groups operate at the AWS network level, not at the instance level. So blocking the data does not take away the processing power of the instances.

> [!info] HTTP Attack
> HTTP requests are sent disguising as real users to overwhelm the server capacity.
> 
> For example, slowloris attacks spend a long time sending its HTTP requests, like a guy in the line that's taking forever to make his order.
> 
> Solution: [elastic load balancing](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^f73a6d) waits for the entire request to finish before sending it to the servers in the [auto-scaling group](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^ccf4fc). ELB prioritizes HTTP requests, so they are always handled first. As ELB runs at the [regional](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^36505c) level, it is too expensive to overwhelm it as well.
> 
> By distributing incoming traffic to different servers and [edge locations](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^8f33ce), ELB, [Amazon CloudFront](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^6894c0), and [Route 53](2.4%20Networking.md#^189bae) reduces the load on individual servers. 

> [!note] AWS Shield
> AWS Shield is an additional layer of protection that analyzes network traffic to identify and block [DDoS](#^b17521) attacks. 
> - **AWS Shield Standard** automatically applies to all servers without extra cost;
> - **AWS Shield Advanced** a paid service that provides detailed attack diagnostics and the ability to detect and mitigate sophisticated DDoS attacks.
> 	- It integrates with other services such as [Amazon CloudFront](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^6894c0), [Elastic Load Balancing](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^f73a6d), and [Route 53](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^165290);
> 	- Uses ML algorithms to identify DDoS traffic and improves over time;
> 	- Integrate AWS Shield with [AWS WAF](#^aa48cb) by writing custom rules to mitigate complex DDoS attacks.

## Additional Security Services

> [!note] AWS Key Management Service
> [AWS KMS](https://aws.amazon.com/kms) enables you to perform encryption operations through the use of **cryptographic keys**. 
> 
> A cryptographic key is a random string of digits used for locking (encrypting) and unlocking (decrypting) data. You can use AWS KMS to create, manage, and use cryptographic keys. You can also control the use of keys across a wide range of services and in your applications.

^645231

> [!info] Key Access
> 
With [AWS KMS](2.6%20Security%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^645231), you can choose the specific levels of access control that you need for your keys. For example, you can specify which [IAM users](#^8ee5e5) and [IAM roles](#^f551e4) are able to manage keys. Alternatively, you can temporarily disable keys so that they are no longer in use by anyone. Your keys never leave AWS KMS, and you are always in control of them.

> [!note] AWS Web Application Firewall
> AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor network requests that come into your web applications.
> 
> AWS WAF works with [Amazon CloudFront](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^6894c0) and an **Application Load Balancer**. The traffic permission is managed by a **web access control list**. IP addresses can be added to the list to block or allow traffic from them. Rules can also be added to block **SQL injection** attacks.

^aa48cb

> [!note] AWS Inspector
> AWS Inspector performs a series of automated security checks and provide a list of security vulnerabilities.

> [!note] Amazon GuardDuty
> Amazon GuardDuty provides intelligent threat detection for your AWS infrastructure and resources. The network and account activity are monitored continuously. 
> 
> Any threats will be shown in a report in the [AWS management console](2.3%20Global%20Infrastructure.md#^a27e82). [Lambda functions](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^071256) can be written to automatically take actions for the security vulnerabilities.

> [!note] AWS Security Hub
> AWS Security Hub is a cloud security posture management (CSPM) service that performs automated, continuous security best practice checks against your AWS resources to help you identify misconfigurations, and aggregates your security alerts (i.e. findings) in a standardized format so that you can more easily enrich, investigate, and remediate them.

> [!note] AWS Secrets Manager
> AWS Secrets Manager allows you to rotate, manage, and retrieve database credentials, API keys, and other secrets through their lifecycle.
