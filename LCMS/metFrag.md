# In-silico Fragmenter

## metFrag

- Pulls stuctures from a chosen database given exact mass and ppm.
- Filter structures for those containing or not containing certain elements and substructures .
- Min and max number of elements can be filtered.
- Scores computed can be customized.
- Input MS2 spectra in mass-intensity pairs.
- Program runs in-silico fragmentation for the filtered structures, compares simulated fragments to input spectra, and give a list of plausible results.
- Gave similar results to [mzLogic](Compound%20Discoverer##mzLogic)
