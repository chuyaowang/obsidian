# Optimal tracers for MFA

## Intro

Choice of tracer **very** important for labeling efficiency and precision of flux estimation (i.e. confidence interval)

## Single tracers

|Tracer|Source|Cost|
| --- | --- | --- |
|[1,6-13C] glucose|sigma-aldrich|$706/100mg, $1590/250mg|
|[5,6-13C] glucose|omicron|$3160/g|
|[1,2-13C] glucose|sigma-aldrich|$379/100mg, $959/500mg, $1690/g|
|[U-13C] glucose|Cambridge Isotope Lab|$325/g|
|[U-12C] glucose|Thermofisher|$507/g|

## Parallel tracers

[1,6-13C] glucose + [1,2-13C] glucose

## In silico simulation

Computer simulation of tracer information score with respect to a defined network
The network used is about sugar metabolism, which aligns with our intention
Information score refers to the precision of the determined flux
However, this assumes the confidence interval of the flux values is linear

## Method proposed in this paper

A new selection method is proposed to account for the non-linearity and select tracers for parallel experiments
