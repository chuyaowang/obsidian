# Limit of Detection and Quantitation

## LOD

The LOD is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be reliably distinguished from the background noise

## LOQ

The LOQ is the lowest concentration of an analyte that can be quantified with a specified level of accuracy and precision.

The LOD and LOQ are typically expressed in units of concentration, such as parts per million (ppm) or parts per billion (ppb). The LOD is typically much lower than the LOQ, since the LOQ must take into account the variability in the analytical method.

## Experimental Determination

Experimental methods for determining the LOD and LOQ typically involve injecting a series of standard solutions of the analyte into the instrument and measuring the signal. The LOD is then defined as the lowest concentration of the analyte that produces a signal that is significantly different from the background noise. The LOQ is then defined as the lowest concentration of the analyte that produces a signal that is within a specified range of the true concentration.

## Calculation

The LOD and LOQ can be calculated using the following formulas:

LOD = 3.3σ / S

LOQ = 10σ / S

where:

-   LOD is the limit of detection
    
-   LOQ is the limit of quantitation
    
-   σ is the standard deviation of the blank signal
    
-   S is the slope of the calibration curve
    

The blank signal is the signal that is measured in the absence of the analyte. The slope of the calibration curve is the ratio of the change in the signal to the change in the concentration of the analyte.

The calculation method for LOD and LOQ comes from the statistical concept of signal-to-noise ratio. The signal-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the signal to the background noise. The higher the signal-to-noise ratio, the more easily the signal can be distinguished from the noise.

The LOD and LOQ are calculated by dividing the standard deviation of the blank signal by the slope of the calibration curve. The standard deviation of the blank signal is a measure of the background noise. The slope of the calibration curve is a measure of the sensitivity of the analytical method.

The factor of 3.3 in the LOD calculation is based on the 95% confidence level. This means that there is a 95% chance that the analyte concentration is above the LOD if the signal is above the LOD.

The factor of 10 in the LOQ calculation is based on the 99% confidence level. This means that there is a 99% chance that the analyte concentration is above the LOQ if the signal is above the LOQ.

The calculation method for LOD and LOQ is widely accepted in the analytical chemistry community. It is used to assess the sensitivity of analytical methods and to compare the performance of different analytical methods.
