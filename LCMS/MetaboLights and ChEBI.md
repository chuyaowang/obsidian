## Metabolism

- Catabolism: breaking down molecules, releasing energy
- Anabolism: synthesizing molecules, consuming energy

## Metabolites

- Primary: essential ones for primary metabolic process; glucose, lactic acid, vitamins
- Secondary: important ecological role or other function; defense mechanisms, role attracting pollinators, or servicing as signaling molecules; alkaloids, flavonoids, terpenoids

## Main tools for metabolomics

- LC-MS
- GC-MS
- NMR: structure and concentration
- Metabolomics Standard Initiative: standard for reporting metabolomics experiment

## MetaboLights

- Database for metabolomics experiment and derived information
- Open-access
- ~9000 studies in metabolites

### Data

- Sample collection, sample preparation, data acquisition, data interpretation

### Data Submission

- Data + metadata

### Use

- Search study
	- Studies contain author, abstract, publication, methods, samples, assays used (positive, negative, column type, instrument used), raw data, annotation file, metadata
- Search metabolites
	- spectra, structure, NMR, etc.

### Data Reuse

- GNPS dashboard, MZmine2
- MetaboLights Labs: open source, open access analysis tool and workflow
	- An app in MetaboLights Labs: metaboLights data provider

## ChEBI

- Database for biological small molecules
- [ChEBI](https://ebi.ac.uk/chebi)
- Contains data
	- Role classes
	- Chemical classes
	- Role classes
- For each entry
	- ChEBI identifier for each compound
	- Chemical names: recommended name, IUPAC name, brand name, common names
	- Properties
	- Ontology: different classifications for each compound
	- Cross reference to other databases
	- Registry names: CAS, Reaxys
	- Citations
	- Species information for natural products

### Search

- Search by name
- Search by structure
- Search all chemicals sharing common ontologies
- Boolean logic

### Submission

- Submit structure, ontology
- Curated by 3rd party (2 stars), or ChEBI (3 stars)
