# Transformer

## Definition

A transformer model is a neural network architecture that uses self-attention to learn long-range dependencies in sequential data. It was first introduced in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have been shown to be very effective for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

## Description

Transformers work by first encoding the input sequence into a sequence of hidden representations. These hidden representations are then decoded to produce the output sequence. The decoder uses self-attention to attend to different parts of the input sequence, allowing it to learn long-range dependencies.

Transformers have several advantages over previous NLP models. They are able to learn [long-range dependencies](Long%20Range%20Dependency.md), which is important for tasks such as machine translation and text summarization. They are also more parallelizable than previous models, which makes them faster to train.

## Applications

Transformers have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks. For example, the transformer-based model Transformer-XL achieved a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 40.6 on the WMT14 English-to-German translation task. The transformer-based model T5 achieved a new state-of-the-art ROUGE score of 48.4 on the CNN/Daily Mail summarization task. And the transformer-based model GPT-3 achieved a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.5% on the SQuAD question answering task.

Transformers are a powerful new tool for NLP. They have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with computers. For example, transformers could be used to create more natural and engaging chatbots. They could also be used to improve the accuracy of machine translation and text summarization systems.

Here are some of the tasks that transformer models are good at:

-   Machine translation
-   Text summarization
-   Question answering
-   Natural language generation
-   Text classification
-   Sentiment analysis
-   Named entity recognition
-   Part-of-speech tagging
-   Dependency parsing
-   Coreference resolution
-   Machine reading comprehension
-   Dialog modeling
-   Chatbots
