# Cartesian Product

The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs where the first element is from $A$ and the second element is from $B$. In other words, it combines each element of $A$ with each element of $B$ to form pairs.

### Mathematical Definition

If $A$ and $B$ are two sets, then their Cartesian product $A \times B$ is defined as:
$$
A \times B = \{ (a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \}
$$

### Example

Suppose:
- $A = \{1, 2\}$
- $B = \{x, y\}$

Then the Cartesian product $A \times B$ is:
$$
A \times B = \{ (1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y) \}
$$

Each element of $A$ is paired with each element of $B$, resulting in all possible ordered pairs.

### Properties
1. **Order Matters**: The pair $(a, b)$ is different from $(b, a)$, so $A \times B$ is not necessarily the same as $B \times A$.
2. **Size**: If $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$, then $|A \times B| = m \cdot n$, meaning the Cartesian product has $m \times n$ elements.
