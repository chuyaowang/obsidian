# Cluster-wise linear regression

## Definition

Cluster-wise regularized linear regression (CLR) is a machine learning method that combines clustering and [linear regression](0.%20Understanding%20Deep%20Learning.md###Linear%20Regression). It is used to model data that is heterogeneous, meaning that the data points do not follow a single linear relationship. CLR works by first clustering the data points into groups that are similar to each other. Then, a linear regression model is fit to each cluster. This allows the model to capture the different linear relationships that exist in the data.

## Application

CLR is a powerful tool that can be used to model a variety of data sets. It has been used in a number of different applications, including:

-   Market segmentation
-   Customer profiling
-   Medical diagnosis
-   Financial forecasting
-   Natural language processing

CLR is a relatively new method, but it has quickly become a popular choice for modeling heterogeneous data. It is a powerful tool that can be used to improve the accuracy of predictions and to gain insights into the data.

## Pros & Cons

Here are some of the advantages of using cluster-wise regularized linear regression:

-   It can handle data that is heterogeneous, meaning that the data points do not follow a single linear relationship.
-   It can capture the different linear relationships that exist in the data.
-   It is a relatively simple method to implement.
-   It is a powerful tool that can be used to model a variety of data sets.

Here are some of the disadvantages of using cluster-wise regularized linear regression:

-   It can be computationally expensive to fit the model.
-   It can be sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters.
-   It can be difficult to interpret the results of the model.
