# Louvain

The Louvain clustering algorithm is a popular method for community detection in networks. It identifies communities in large networks by optimizing [Modularity](Modularity.md), a measure of the strength of division of a network into modules. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the Louvain algorithm clusters nodes:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Each node starts in its own community. Thus, initially, there are as many communities as there are nodes.

1. **Modularity Optimization (First Phase)**:
   - For each node, consider moving it to the community of each of its neighbors. Calculate the change in modularity for each possible move.
   - The node is moved to the community that results in the highest increase (or smallest decrease) in modularity. If no move results in a positive change, the node stays in its current community.
   - This process is repeated iteratively for all nodes until no further improvement in modularity can be achieved by moving any node.

3. **Community Aggregation (Second Phase)**:
   - Once the first phase is complete, a new network is created where each community from the first phase is treated as a single node.
   - The weight of the edge between two new nodes is the sum of the weights of the edges between nodes in the corresponding two communities.

4. **Repetition**:
   - The algorithm then repeats the modularity optimization on the new, smaller network. Nodes within this network represent communities of the original network.
   - The two phases (modularity optimization and community aggregation) are repeated until no further improvement in modularity is possible.

5. **Final Communities**:
   - The algorithm outputs the final set of communities, which are the groups of nodes in the original network that are highly interconnected.

## Key Concepts in the Louvain Algorithm:

- **Modularity**: A measure of the strength of the division of a network into communities. It compares the density of edges inside communities to edges between communities.
- **Local Move**: Moving a node to a neighboring community to increase modularity.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: The algorithm builds a hierarchy of communities by aggregating nodes and reapplying the algorithm on the condensed networks.

## Example Walkthrough:

1. **Initial State**:
   - Suppose we have a small network with nodes A, B, C, D, and E. Initially, each node is its own community: {A}, {B}, {C}, {D}, {E}.

2. **First Phase**:
   - Move A to B's community if it increases modularity. Repeat for all nodes.
   - After a series of moves, suppose we end up with communities {A, B}, {C, D}, and {E}.

3. **Second Phase**:
   - Aggregate these communities into super-nodes: {A, B}, {C, D}, and {E}.
   - The new network has these super-nodes connected by edges with weights representing the total number of edges between the original communities.

4. **Repetition**:
   - Apply the modularity optimization again on this new network of super-nodes.
   - Continue this process until no further modularity improvement is possible.

## Benefits of the Louvain Algorithm:

- **Scalability**: It can handle large networks efficiently.
- **Hierarchical**: Provides a multi-level decomposition of the network.
- **Modularity Maximization**: Focuses on maximizing modularity, which often correlates well with meaningful community structure.

By following these steps, the Louvain algorithm effectively clusters nodes into communities based on the network structure, optimizing for high modularity to ensure dense connections within communities and sparse connections between them.
