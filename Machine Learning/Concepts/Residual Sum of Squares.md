# RSS

RSS (Residual Sum of Squares) is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a regression model.

## Residual Sum of Squares (RSS)

RSS measures the total deviation of the observed values from the values predicted by the model. It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the residuals (errors).

$$\text{RSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$$

where:
- $y_i$ is the actual value for the $i$-th observation.
- $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted value for the $i$-th observation.
- $n$ is the number of observations.
