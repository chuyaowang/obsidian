# Scoring Matrices

[0. VU Algorithms in Sequence Analysis](0.%20VU%20Algorithms%20in%20Sequence%20Analysis.md)

## Measuring alignment similarity

- Sequence identity: number of identical exchanges per unit length
- Raw alignment score: the score obtained by DP
- Sequence similarity: alignment score normalized to a maximum possible
- Alignment score normalized to a randomly expected situation (database/homology searching - later lectures)

### Statistical alignment score

**Z score**:
- Alignment score normalized to a randomly expected situation
- shuffle one or both sequences
- calculate alignment score
- a
- a

## Substitution scores


### Simple matrix

- an identity matrix

### Jukes-Cantor


### Kimura
