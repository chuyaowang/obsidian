## Algorithms

**Algorithm**: a well-defined finite set of rules that specifies a sequential series of elementary operations to be applied to some data called the input, producing after a finite amount of time some data called the output

To solve a computational problem we usually **design** an algorithm, and then **analyze** its performance.

### Type of analysis

Different types of analysis for computational resources (e.g. time, space, communication, etc.): 
- Worst case: the biggest amount of some computational resource (e.g. longest running time) required by the algorithm for any input. 
- Best case: the smallest amount of some computational resource required by the algorithm for any input. 
- Average case: the amount of some computational resource required by the algorithm averaged over all possible inputs. Common in bioinformatics that uses heuristics in algorithms, such as [The BLAST Algorithm and Inexact Matching](3.%20MIT%20CompBio%20-%20Hashing,%20Database%20Search,%20BLAST%20algorithm.md#The%20BLAST%20Algorithm%20and%20Inexact%20Matching).
