## IC50


## Cancer background

- aberrations in signal transduction networks are a hallmark of cancer
- many drugs target signaling proteins
- problem
	- single targets drugs often ineffective
		- multiple low dose drug combination
	- Resistance develops rapidly
- **Hypothesis**: different cell populations are in different cell states: characterized by **different signal networks** - giving rise to heterogeneity
- How do individual cells respond to drug treatment

## Methods

### Single cell (phospho)-protein quantification upon drug response using scID-seq

- Vary p70S6Ki and p90-RSKi levels and observe downstream effect
	- i stands for inhibitor
- Measure ~70 phospho-proteins using antibodies
	- phospho-proteins are in activated form

### Drug treatments propagates through the network


### Take away

- drug treatment affects many proteins
- there is considerable within-treatment variability

### Cell clustering

- Cell states are determined from antibodies that do not respond significantly to treatment
- Found 9 clusters
- Antibodies not used in cell state clustering show cell state dependent profiles
- Protein expression can be drug-specific, cell-state specific, or a combination
	- combination effect can be studied with linear regression with an interaction term

### What explains the cell state specific drug response

- Cell state specific network reconstruction
	- which two proteins interact
	- -
	- -
	- use correlation
	- need perturbation experiments
- Natural variation in total protein serves as natural perturbation experiments
- deviation of active protein = effect of total protein variation + interaction strength * deviation of upstream proteins + direct perturbation effect
- an optimization problem: find a network that best explains the data

### Network reconstruction from ...

- Network topology based on pri okn supp 
- Compare to random network topology, the model describes the data much better
- Regularization strength can be tuned
	- 30 cell-state specific edges gives a good balance between model fit and complexity

### Permutation analysis identifies which differences are significant


## Example: can we understand the cell state specific drug response of cyclin B1

- Cyclin B1 is activated in cell state 5
- MK2 activation only affect cyclin B1 in cell state 5
- MK2 is activated through feedback of ERK upon RSK inhibition
- but why cyclin B1 is only affected in cell state 5

### Hypothesis

- cell state 5 are cells undergoing mitosis

## How general is this

- Nodes with cell state dependent drug response are enriched for cell state dependent edges

## Conclusion and outlook

- The response of a protein to a drug can be cell state dependent
- SC comparative network reconstruction identifies cell state specific networks
- cell state dpeendt drug respon and signal transduction are closely related
- Outlook: idenfiy non-responsive subpopulations and protose combination treatments based on their signaling network
