## Melanoma resistance

- Deadly cancer
- More diagnosis in years

### Drivers of melanoma

- 50% BRAF
- 20% NRAS

### Drug

- Targeting RAF: vemurafenib
- Problem: cancer develops resistance

## Resistance study

- Follow patients through 6 months
- Observed ERK expression: MAPK pathway still works, not blocked by vemurafenib
- Whole exosome sequencing: only sequence the coding region
- Compared cancer and normal exome

### Mutation

- Found 1 mutation: 3 base pair insertion
- Independent from BRAF level -> not affected by drug
- Does not help explaining the resistance

### Count the number of DNA

- Copy number difference from exome data
- Spread over the genome
- Uneven noise levels

### CopywriteR: Off target DNA copy number detection

- Use off-target to fix uneven distribution
- Found high peak in chromosome 7 where BRAF is located
- BRAF forms dimers and disables the drug
- Amplifcation of 3 types of tumors are not identical

## Identify combination of drugs

- To treat heterogenous drugs

### PDX platform (patient derived xenograft)

- Take small piece of tumor tissue
- Place in immune compromised mice and let the tumor tissue grow
- Extract tissue and placed in second mice and let it passage more
- At more than passage 5 or 6, tumor begins to adapt to mice

### The problem

- Found many more mutations than expected
- Sequenced also mice tissue. The mice DNA is mapped to human genome and identified as mutations

### Developed a tool

- Map to human genome
- Map to mice genome
- Compare the number of hits and keep the data that fits best to human genome

### Splice variants as resistance mechanism

- Found unexpected higher band: duplication of a kinase domain
- BRAF double kinase
- WGS found a duplication of a genomic region

### inhibiting the BRAF double kinase

- Binding of the drug to one side of the dimer stops binding on the other dimer
- So signaling still happens down the MAPK pathway
- New drug developed can bind on two sides
- Resistance can still develop

## The importance of bioinformatics in translational medicine

- Whole exome sequencing in human and PDX
- Mouse genome sequencing

## Resistance to immune checkpoint blockage immune therapy

- Lower resistance
- Higher survival in metastatic melanomas

## NKI: immune checkpoint inhibition research


## Neogene

- Cell therapy
- bought by AstroZeneca
- Research in NL, production in the US

### T cell response in a nutshell

- Antigen presenting cells: MHC complex presents small segment of tumor protein
- T cells recognizes abnormal molecules presented by MHC cells and eliminate them
- Tumor can circumvent this mechanism
- Immune checkpoint blockade: release the brakes on T cells
	- Side effects: lose epithelial lining of intestine

### Engineered T cells made at Neogene

- Reduce side effects
- More durable
- TCR discovery platform: replace t cells from patient using t cell receptor discovered and multiply the engineered T cells

### Neogene's clinical rpgoram

1. Match TCR to patient
2. Use TCR identified in patient populations: match patient to TCR

### Neogene bioinformatics team

- also T cell engineering, software development, data generation
- internship position

### Time frame

- 26 weeks from taking patient tissue to starting therapy
