## Goal of statistical hypothesis testing

- Test if the distribution of a random variable $X$ depend on another variable (condition, disease, etc.)
- The precision or dispersion affect the answer

### A case of statistical hypothesis testing

Measure concentrations $a$ and $b$ under 2 conditions
- Null hypothesis: no difference between $a$ and $b$

### Definition of the p value

**p value**: the probability of measuring the observed value or a more extremetvalue, when $H_0$ is true

One sided t test: test for a direction of difference (increase or decrease)
Two sided t test: test for if a difference exists (both increase and decrease)

### Statistical tests vs. the truth

|          $H_0$          | Accept       | Reject       |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| True | True Negative (TN)  | False Positive (FP) |
| False | False Negative (FN) | True Positive (TP)  |
- Interesting when the null hypothesis is rejected
- type I error when FP
- type II error when FN
- The p-value only tells us something about the cases in the first row where _$H_0$ is True_

### Type I error control

- The $\alpha$ level, or a “p-value cut-off” is the accepted level of a false positive conclusions or **Type I errors**, _i.e._ the probability of rejecting $H_0$ when $H_0$ is true.
- Using an $\alpha$ level for rejection of $H_0$ is called type I error control

### Questions regarding the p-value



## Count data

### RNA-seq

[scRNA-seq](scRNA-seq.md)

- Steps
	- Isolate messenger RNA ([mRNA](mRNA.md))
	- Make cDNA
	- Add adaptors for sequencing
	- Read sequences of fragments
	- Map sequences to genes (open reading frames)
	- The result is the count of each gene in each sample
- Source of variation
	- Example set-up: sequencing gene <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">red</mark> from all genes
	- The number of mRNA molecules per sample
	- The percentage of mRNA from red gene per sample
- Example
	- replicates of treated and untreated and gene counts
	- the total count per sample varies
	- the gene count for the same gene varies
### Bias in RNA-seq counts

- Variation in counts due to technical variation:
	- Variation in amount of isolated mRNA
	- Variation in quality of isolated mRNA
	- Variation in cDNA synthesis efficiency
	- Variation in sequencing efficiency
- Lead to variation in total counts

### Normalization of total counts

- Simple method
	- Assuming that variation is due to technical reasons and not because concentrations of all mRNA actually differ:
	- **Solution**: divide sequence count for each gene by the total count in the sample
	- **Yields**: RPM, Rate Per Million reads
- Advanced method
	- Assume that only a limited number of mRNA differ between samples due to technical or biological reasons
	- **Solution**: perform robust linear regression1
	- **Yields**: Size factor for each sample

See [book](https://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/08-chap.html) for advanced method

### A random count variable X for a gene


## Variance stabilization

- When variance is different, statistical tests that require equivariance, such as t test and anova, cannot be performed.

### Variance definition

- Variance of a random variable
- Variance of a random variable
- [Variance](Variance.md)
- [Standard Deviation](Standard%20Deviation.md)

### Variable variance

- Homoscedasticity: 
- Heteroscedasticity:
- Problems with heteroscedasticity

### Investigate the variance before doing statistical test


### Many experimental variables have proportional error
