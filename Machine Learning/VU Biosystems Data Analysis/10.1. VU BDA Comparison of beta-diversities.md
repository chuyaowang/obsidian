## When to Use Each Distance Metric?

### 1️⃣ Aitchison Distance (CLR-based Euclidean)

🔹 **Best for:** **Compositional data analysis** (e.g., microbiome, geochemistry)  
🔹 **Why?**

- Handles the **constant sum constraint** in microbiome data using **CLR transformation**.
- Ideal for **ordination methods** (e.g., PCA, PCoA).
- Avoids misleading relationships caused by raw relative abundances.
- **Use when comparing community compositions while preserving proportional relationships**.

🚫 **When NOT to use it:**

- If your data is presence/absence only.
- If phylogenetic relationships are important.

---

### 2️⃣ Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity

🔹 **Best for:** **Comparing ecological communities based on abundance**  
🔹 **Why?**

- Measures **community structure shifts** by comparing proportional abundance differences.
- Works well when dominant taxa drive ecological differences.
- Used in **beta diversity** analyses when **phylogeny is not important**.

🚫 **When NOT to use it:**

- If phylogenetic information matters (e.g., evolutionary relationships).
- If your data is compositional (can produce misleading results due to sum constraint).

---

### 3️⃣ Unweighted UniFrac Distance

🔹 **Best for:** **Detecting differences in microbial membership (presence/absence)**  
🔹 **Why?**

- Incorporates **phylogenetic distances** between taxa.
- Sensitive to the presence/absence of rare taxa.
- Useful for **measuring evolutionary distinctiveness** between microbial communities.

🚫 **When NOT to use it:**

- If relative abundances matter (it treats all taxa equally).
- If dominant taxa drive community differences.

---

### 4️⃣ Weighted UniFrac Distance

🔹 **Best for:** **Comparing phylogenetic community composition while considering abundance**  
🔹 **Why?**

- Accounts for **phylogenetic relationships** AND **relative abundances**.
- Emphasizes dominant taxa, reducing the influence of rare species.
- Useful for gut microbiome studies where **key species drive functional shifts**.

🚫 **When NOT to use it:**

- If rare taxa are important (it downplays their role).
- If you're interested in presence/absence instead of abundance differences.

## Summary: Which Distance to Use?

|**Analysis Goal**|**Best Distance Metric**|
|---|---|
|General compositional microbiome analysis|**Aitchison (CLR-based)**|
|Community structure based on abundance|**Bray-Curtis**|
|Phylogenetic similarity (presence/absence)|**Unweighted UniFrac**|
|Phylogenetic similarity (including abundance)|**Weighted UniFrac**|

## Final Thoughts

- **Use Aitchison distance** if you want the most statistically sound approach for **compositional** microbiome data.
- **Use Bray-Curtis** if **phylogeny doesn’t matter** but **abundance** does.
- **Use Unweighted UniFrac** if you're interested in **species membership differences**.
- **Use Weighted UniFrac** if you want **both phylogeny and abundance considered**.
