## Natural Language Models

### Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical field within artificial intelligence, combining computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques to enable computers to process and understand human language in both text and voice forms.

### Key Processes in NLP

1. **Tokenization -** Breaking down text into smaller units (tokens), such as words or phrases, for easier analysis.
2. **Parsing -** Analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand how words relate to each other.
3. **Semantic Analysis -** Understanding the meaning behind words by considering context, synonyms, and ambiguities.
4. **Contextual Understanding -** Utilizing the context of surrounding sentences to enhance interpretation, including understanding implied meanings and intentions.
5. **Statistical Inference -** Using probabilities to predict subsequent words or appropriate responses in a conversation.
6. **Machine Learning Integration -** Continuously learning from new inputs to improve language prediction and understanding.

NLP is crucial in enabling machines to decode human language, comprehend the intended meaning, and generate coherent, relevant responses.

It represents a complex interplay of various processes that equip machines with linguistic understanding capabilities.

## Evolution of LLMs

1. **Rule-Based Systems -** Early models based on explicit grammatical and syntactic rules, limited and inflexible.
2. **Statistical Models -** Shifted to probability-based predictions, enabling more complex language processing.
	- ex. rabbit has a high probability of following white 
3. **Machine Learning Models -** Began understanding context and patterns, but struggled with long-range dependencies.
4. **Neural Networks (RNNs and LSTMs) -** Improved handling of sequences and memory, marking significant progress.
	- See [4. VU DL Sequential Data](Machine%20Learning/VU%20Deep%20Learning/4.%20VU%20DL%20Sequential%20Data.md) for RNN and LSTM
5. **Transformer-Based Architectures -** Introduced attention mechanisms, allowing models to weigh the importance of each part of the sentence, thus capturing intricate relationships and context.
	- How important is each word in relation to every other word
	- [8. VU DL Self Attention](Machine%20Learning/VU%20Deep%20Learning/8.%20VU%20DL%20Self%20Attention.md)

## How LLMs Work

1. **Transformer-Based Architectures** - These are types of neural network architectures that have become fundamental in state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models. They're particularly adept at handling long sequences of data and learning complex patterns.
2. **Attention Mechanism** - A core concept in Transformer architectures. The attention mechanism, particularly self-attention, allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in a sentence in relation to every other word.
3. **Context Capture in Text** - Transformers are notable for their ability to capture context across long stretches of text. This is a significant advancement over rule-based, statistical, and traditional machine learning approaches.
4. **Tokenization** - The process of breaking down a sentence into tokens, which can be individual words or parts of words.
5. **Embeddings** - The numerical representations of words or tokens, typically in the form of vectors. Embeddings convert words into a format that can be processed by neural networks and other algorithms. They capture and quantify aspects of word meanings, their use in different contexts, and their syntactic roles.
6. **Self-Attention in Transformers** - This technique is used to calculate attention scores for each token, determining how much focus to put on other tokens in the sentence. It leads to a _context-aware representation_ of each word.

## Encoders and Decoders

- **Definition of Encoders and Decoders**:
	- Encoders and decoders are distinct components in transformer models that process input and generate output.
- **Function of the Encoder**:
	- The encoder processes input text and converts it into numerical values known as embeddings. 
	- These embeddings are passed through multiple layers of the encoder. 
	- The encoder uses self-attention mechanisms to consider other words in the input when understanding each specific word. 
	- The result is a context-rich representation of the input text.
- **Function of the Decoder**:
	- The decoder generates output text based on the representations produced by the encoder.
	- It also contains multiple layers of self-attention mechanisms but operates differently from the encoder.
	- In models where output is generated one token at a time, the decoder uses _previously generated tokens_ as additional context for producing the next token.
- **Decoding Strategies**:
	- **Greedy Decoding**:
	    - Picks the most likely next word at each step.
	    - Efficient but can lead to suboptimal overall sequences.
	- **Beam Search**:
	    - Tracks multiple possible sequences (beam width) to find a better overall sequence of words.
	    - Balances between the best local choices and the best overall sequence up to that point.
	- **Top-K Sampling**:
	    - Randomly selects the next word from the top K most likely candidates.
	    - Introduces randomness, making text generation less deterministic and potentially more diverse.
	- **Top-P (Nucleus) Sampling**:
	    - Chooses words from a set whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold (P).
	    - Focuses on high-probability options leading to more dynamic and contextually varied outputs.
- **Impact of Decoding Strategies**:
	- The choice of decoding strategy significantly impacts the quality and style of the generated text.
	- Different strategies lead to varying balances between coherence, diversity, and computational efficiency.
- **Temperature Setting**:
	- A model parameter called temperature can control the randomness of token predictions.
	- A higher temperature results in more randomness, while a lower temperature makes the model more confident and less random in its predictions.
- **Variations in Model Architecture**:
	- Some LLM models do not use separate encoders and decoders.
	- In these models, only the decoder component is used to both understand the input and generate output text.
	- The architecture relies on a self-attention mechanism in the decoder to process the entire sequence of tokens at once.

### Encoder-decoder vs. decoder only

Here’s a breakdown of the two styles of Transformer‑based LLMs—**encoder–decoder** vs. **decoder‑only**—and why each is structured the way it is:

---

#### 1. Encoder–Decoder (“Seq2Seq”) Architecture

1. **Structure**
    - **Encoder** stack: bidirectional self‑attention layers that read the entire input sequence at once.
    - **Decoder** stack: (a) masked self‑attention over previously generated tokens, plus (b) cross‑attention over the encoder’s outputs.
2. **How it works**
    - **Encoding phase**: the encoder turns each input token into a context‑rich embedding by letting every token “see” all other tokens (via self‑attention).
    - **Decoding phase**: at generation time, the decoder:
        1. Looks at what it has already generated (masked self‑attention),
        2. Looks back at the encoder’s representations (cross‑attention),
        3. Predicts the next token.
3. **When it shines**
    - Tasks where **input** and **output** are different modalities or languages—e.g. translation, summarization, image captioning.
    - Separation of concerns lets the encoder fully optimize understanding of the input, and the decoder focus purely on generation.

---

#### 2. Decoder‑Only (Autoregressive) Architecture

1. **Structure**
    - A single stack of masked self‑attention layers.
    - All tokens—whether “prompt” (input) or “completion” (output)—live in one sequence, and each token can only attend to earlier ones.
2. **How it works**
    - During inference, you feed in the “prompt” tokens first. Because of causal (left‑to‑right) masking, each prompt token still attends to all tokens before it, so the model builds up an internal representation of the prompt as it goes.
    - As you generate, you simply append newly predicted tokens to the same stream and continue; no separate cross‑attention step is needed.
3. **Why no separate encoder?**
    - **Unified representation**: masked self‑attention already lets the model “understand” the prompt by attending over its own past, building context implicitly.
    - **Simplicity**: a single stack means fewer parameters (no duplicate layers), simpler training (just next‑token prediction), and very efficient deployment.
    - **Sufficient for many tasks**: since the model is trained on massive “prompt→continuation” examples, it learns to both interpret and extend text with just autoregression.

---

#### 3. Key Contrasts

|Aspect|Encoder–Decoder|Decoder‑Only|
|---|---|---|
|**Attention flow**|Encoder self‑attention → Decoder masked self‑attention + cross‑attention|Masked self‑attention only|
|**Parameterization**|Two separate stacks|One unified stack|
|**Core training**|Usually “denoising” (e.g. reconstructing output from corrupted input)|Next‑token prediction|
|**Best use cases**|Seq2seq: translation, summarization, modality conversion|Free‑form generation, completion, chatbots|
|**Inference**|Two‑stage: encode input, then decode with cross‑attention|Single stage: feed prompt, then autoregress|

---

#### 4. Why Each Design Is Chosen

- **Encoder–Decoder**
    - **Full bidirectional context** on inputs (via encoder self‑attention) yields richer understanding, which is critical when the output must depend on every nuance of the input (e.g. translating idioms).
    - **Dedicated cross‑attention** in the decoder ensures the model can align generated tokens precisely with the encoded input.
- **Decoder‑Only**
    - **Prompt self‑attention** suffices to build up context: each prompt token, when processed sequentially, already “looks back” over the whole prompt.
    - **Unified training objective** (predict next token) scales beautifully to enormous datasets and model sizes, powering general‑purpose text generation without needing task‑specific encoder training.

---

#### In a Nutshell

- **Encoder–Decoder**: best when you need a sharp division between “understand this input fully” and “then generate a potentially very different output.”
- **Decoder‑Only**: best when you want a single, highly scalable model that treats everything—both what you feed in and what it spits out—as one continuous text stream.

## Storing LLM Knowledge

- Stored as weights and network structure in files
	- extensions like `.bin` or `.h5`
- LLMs can hallucinate, producing plausible looking outcomes
- Utilization of knowledge
	-  **Prompt-Driven Activation** - The application of stored knowledge is triggered by prompts, acting as keys to unlock the model’s potential. Crafting effective prompts is crucial for accurate and contextually appropriate outputs.
	- **Knowledge Application** - Once activated, LLMs analyze their parameters, applying learned insights to generate responses. In critical domains like legal or medical sectors, LLMs can incorporate real-time data, ensuring outputs are both linguistically coherent and factually accurate.
- Business implication: In the modern business environment, LLMs transcend their role as mere data repositories. They actively interpret and generate language, turning extensive, unstructured data into actionable business insights.

## Prompts and Prompt Engineering

### The Art and Science of Prompt Engineering

- **Crafting Prompts** - Much like an engineer designs systems for specific functions, prompt engineering involves creating prompts that guide LLMs to achieve desired outcomes. It's a blend of understanding the model's interpretive abilities and creatively eliciting the best responses.
- **Importance of Context** - Context in prompts is vital. It not only guides the model's response but also helps in disambiguating meanings and maintaining coherence in the conversation or text generation.
- **Task Specificity** - LLMs are versatile and can perform a range of tasks. Through prompt engineering, users can direct the model to address specific requirements, whether it's generating text, answering questions, or solving problems.

### Key Elements in Prompt Engineering

- **Clarity** - Prompts should be clear and direct to avoid confusion, guiding the LLM toward the intended task.
- **Conciseness** - While context is important, prompts should also be concise to avoid overloading the model with unnecessary information.
- **Format** - Aligning the prompt with the model's training, such as using a question-answer format, can enhance the accuracy of the response.

## Types of Prompts

**Zero-Shot Prompting** - Providing a language model with a task without any examples of how to perform it. The model relies on its pre-training to generate a response. Example: asking for a translation without providing previous examples.

**Few-Shot Prompting** - Giving the model a few examples of the task along with the prompt. These examples guide the model in understanding what's expected and demonstrate the desired output format.

**Chain of Thought Prompting** - A technique that involves guiding the model through a step-by-step reasoning process. It's useful for complex tasks that require logic or reasoning, like math problems or cause-and-effect questions.

### Contextual Importance in LLMs

- **Guiding Responses** - The context provided in prompts ensures that the responses are accurate, detailed, and relevant to the query.
- **Disambiguation** - It helps in clarifying ambiguous terms or phrases, enhancing the model's understanding.
- **Relevance** - The more relevant the context, the more on-point the LLM's output, avoiding generic or off-topic responses.

Effective prompt engineering is about striking a balance – providing enough context to guide the model while keeping the input focused and relevant. This approach enables users to harness the full potential of LLMs, turning them into powerful tools for a wide array of applications in business, research, and creative domains.

## Applying Prompt Engineering

Each time you enter a prompt, the model processes your request and generates a response. AI models operate based on:

- **Token usage**: The number of words (input + output) the model processes.
- **Latency**: The time it takes for the model to generate a response.
- **Computational cost**: Some models require more processing power, affecting performance and efficiency.

In a production environment, understanding these metrics is essential to optimize AI performance and reduce unnecessary costs.

## Retrieval Augmented Generation

- **What Is Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)?**
    - A hybrid NLP approach combining a large language model’s (LLM) generative power with an external knowledge retrieval step
    - Enables up‑to‑date, factual, and domain‑specific responses beyond the LLM’s frozen training data
- **Two Main Phases of RAG**
    1. **Retrieval Step**
        - The system **searches** a document store (e.g. database, vector index, search engine) for relevant passages
        - Uses a **retrieval model** trained to rank or fetch documents most likely to contain the needed information
        - Retrieval models can be:
            - **Sparse** (e.g. BM25, TF‑IDF) matching based on keywords
            - **Dense** (neural) encoders mapping queries and documents into the same vector space, enabling semantic search
            - **Hybrid** systems combining both approaches for precision and recall
    2. **Generation Step**
        - The LLM ingests the retrieved texts as extra context (“knowledge snippets”)
        - Integrates those facts with its internal world‑model to produce a coherent, informed response
- **Retrieval Model: More Context**
    - **Purpose**: Quickly narrow a large corpus down to a handful of pertinent documents
    - **Training**: Often fine‑tuned on query–document relevance judgments (e.g. MS MARCO, in‑domain QA pairs)
    - **Deployment**:
        - **Indexing**: Precompute document representations (vectors or inverted indices)
        - **Querying**: Encode user prompt into the same space, then retrieve nearest neighbors
    - **Benefits**: Ensures the generation phase has factual anchors, reduces hallucination risk
- **Why RAG?**
    - Overcomes LLMs’ static knowledge cutoff by tapping live or specialized databases
    - Improves factual accuracy and specificity, especially in technical or rapidly evolving fields
    - Allows lightweight LLMs to punch above their weight by outsourcing heavy knowledge storage
- **Prompt Engineering in RAG**
    - Prompts serve dual roles:
        1. **Retrieval trigger**—the way you phrase the query influences which documents are fetched
        2. **Generation guide**—the prompt plus retrieved context defines the tone, scope, and detail level
    - A well‑crafted prompt maximizes relevance of retrieved docs and clarity of the final answer
- **Typical RAG System Architecture**
    1. **Indexer** (builds and stores document representations)
    2. **Retriever** (encodes prompt, fetches top‑k documents)
    3. **Reranker** (optional: refines retrieval results for precision)
    4. **Generator** (LLM with context‑injection mechanism, e.g. prepending retrieved text)
- **Medical Domain Example**
    - **Use Case**: Summarizing latest epidemiology of Lytico‑bodig disease
    - **Retrieval**: Query a medical literature database → fetches clinical trials, meta‑analyses, journal articles
    - **Generation**: LLM synthesizes key findings (e.g. higher prevalence in Guam, environmental links)
    - **Outcome**: Accurate, current summary that LLM alone could not provide from pre‑2023 training
- **Advantages of RAG**
    - Up‑to‑date answers without retraining the entire LLM
    - Access to specialized or proprietary corpora
    - Reduced hallucinations by grounding outputs in real documents
- **Cautions & Best Practices**
    - **Verification**: Always cross‑check RAG outputs against trusted sources, especially in high‑stakes fields like medicine
    - **Document Quality**: Garbage‑in, garbage‑out—ensure underlying knowledge base is curated and reliable
    - **Latency & Cost**: Retrieval introduces extra compute; balance freshness, accuracy, and efficiency
- **End‑to‑End RAG Workflow**
    1. **User prompt** →
    2. **Retrieval model** fetches top‑k docs →
    3. **Prompt + docs** fed into LLM →
    4. **LLM generates** grounded, context‑rich answer →
    5. **Human review** (optional) to validate and refine
- **Key Takeaway**
    - RAG marries the **scalability** of LLM generation with the **precision** of information retrieval, creating systems that are both creative and factually reliable.

## Foundation Models

Foundation models represent a significant shift in machine learning and artificial intelligence. They serve as versatile and powerful platforms for a variety of applications, thanks to their extensive training and generalization capabilities. Here's a concise overview of their key attributes:

1. **Scale** - These models are colossal in size, often encompassing billions of parameters, making them capable of learning from and processing enormous datasets.
    
2. **Generalization** - Their design enables them to generalize knowledge across different languages, tasks, and domains. This broad scope allows them to capture a vast array of information and nuances.
    
3. **Adaptability** - One of their standout features is adaptability. Foundation models can be fine-tuned with additional training to cater to specific tasks or requirements, enhancing their flexibility and utility in various applications.
    
4. **Capabilities** - They boast a range of capabilities across different modalities, such as text and images. This versatility makes them suitable for diverse applications like language translation, question-answering, content summarization, image recognition, and more.
    
5. **Shared Architecture** - A single foundation model can act as a base for developing numerous specialized models. This approach significantly reduces the resources and time required to develop new models for different tasks, as it eliminates the need to train a new model from the ground up for each specific application.
    

Examples of foundation models include BERT for natural language understanding, GPT-3 for generative text applications, and T5, which handles a range of text-based tasks. The concept extends beyond language models, encompassing any pre-trained model that offers a foundational platform for further specialized learning and application development.

## Fine-tuning LLMs

Fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) effectively customizes it for specialized tasks, leveraging its broad learning capabilities to adapt to specific domains or industries. This process refines the model's expertise, making it highly useful for niche applications. Let’s break down the key stages and outcomes of this process:

1. **Pre-Trained Model** - The foundation of fine-tuning is a model that has already been trained on a vast corpus of general text data. This extensive pre-training equips the model with a wide-ranging understanding of language.
    
2. **Specialized Dataset Preparation** - The specific task or domain dictates the dataset for fine-tuning. For instance, legal documents and texts are prepared for fine-tuning a model for legal applications.
    
3. **Fine-Tuning Process** - The model undergoes additional training on this specialized dataset. This stage involves adjusting the model's weights and parameters to align more closely with the domain-specific language, style, and content. The learning rate during fine-tuning is typically lower, allowing for subtle yet effective modifications.
    
4. **Gaining Task-Specific Abilities** - Post fine-tuning, the model becomes more proficient in handling the particularities of the new domain. This includes a better grasp of specific terminologies, writing styles, and types of queries or tasks pertinent to the dataset it was fine-tuned on.
    
5. **Enhanced Performance in Specialized Tasks** - The fine-tuned model now exhibits improved performance and accuracy in tasks related to its specialized training. This makes it a valuable asset for professionals within that specific field, such as legal experts, medical practitioners, or chemical engineers, depending on the focus of fine-tuning.
    
6. **Customization for Organizational Needs** - Organizations can leverage fine-tuning to tailor LLMs to their unique requirements. This could range from enhancing customer service interactions to generating content that aligns with a brand’s voice or providing technical support in a specific industry.
    

In essence, fine-tuning transforms a generalist LLM into a specialist tool, extending its utility beyond general applications to more focused, domain-specific tasks. This process exemplifies the flexibility and adaptability of LLMs, showcasing their potential to provide bespoke solutions across various sectors.
