## My prompt

Build an app according to the following specifications. The purpose tells the design principle. The rules are rules to follow when making the schedule. The audience is the target audience of the app. The Input/Output describes what input should the user provide and what output they should get:

Purpose: a day planner that given the user's list of things to do, their priorities, and the time it takes can arrange the things in different parts of the day.  Additionally, the app should talk to the user 

Rules: The arrangement should be made considering not only the priorities but also the physiology of an average person. For example, a person is more energized but less focused in the morning and becomes a little tired but more focused in the afternoon, meaning different tasks are suitable for different times of the day. Tasks that the user has inputed can also be broken down (for example, breaking down a 2-hour task into 2 1-hour blocks) so the user doesn't get bored working on the same thing. 

There should also be breaks inserted during proper intervals such that the user is not overly exhausted from work. The length of the breaks should be set up to a max of 30 mins according to the complexity of the task at hand, which the app should analyze using its reasoning capability. The app should also recommend proper relaxing activities for the breaks. The schedule should span an entire 24-hour day including sleep, wake-up, time for 3 meals a day, and time to go to bed. The time for sleep, wake-up, time for 3 meals a day, and time to go to bed should be set such that the user's can finish his tasks of the day. When this is impossible, give user a warning in the output.

Audience: a busy working individual needing advice on planning their day such that they can get their job done while maintaining a healthy body. 

Input/Output: 

First of all a task list should be formulated based on user input. The user's input should be taken in with text box entry including for each task: the thing to do, the priority with qualitative descriptions such as high, mid, low, and how many hours it will take. If the user's input is not complete with time it takes and priority. Analyze the tasks and give estimates on the time the tasks take and their priority in relation to each other. The user can enter as many things as they want, but a warning should be given if the things cannot be done within a 12-hour work day. Brief instructions on what user should enter and what the app will do using the information to draft the task lift should be given. 

After the task list is created, the app should generate a quote of the day, a day schedule based on the user's inputs in the format of a table containing the beginning and ending time and the task for the time slot, and explain why such arrangements are made. Based on additional user feedback, the schedule needs to be updated according to user specifications. When making the adjustments, the general rules given in the rules part should still be followed, but when they conflict with user specifications, the user's specifications should be given a higher consideration.

## Trial input
