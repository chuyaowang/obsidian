## History

- Alan Turing (1950s): Can computers think?
- Eliza (1960s): first chatbot
- Neural networks (2010s)
- AI in daily lifes (2020s)
- Today: AI everywhere
	- taking photos
	- healthcare
	- farming
	- optimizing traffic flows
	- more

### Eliza

- Joseph Weizenbaum, MIT in 1960s
- Can act as a therapist just by repeating what the user says
- Use basic pattern recognition
- Type `*help` to see all commands
- Type `*traceauto` to view how the response is formed
- [Eliza demo](https://anthay.github.io/eliza.html)

> [!info] How Eliza works
> ELIZA is an early example of a natural language processing program that simulates conversation by using pattern matching and a set of predefined rules. Here’s how it works:
> 
> 1. **Pattern Matching**: ELIZA analyzes the user's input for specific keywords or phrases. It looks for patterns in the text that match its predefined rules. For example, if the user says something like "I feel sad," ELIZA recognizes the keyword "sad."
> 
> 2. **Response Generation**: Once a pattern is matched, ELIZA generates a response based on the recognized keywords. The responses are not generated through understanding but rather through a set of rules that dictate what to say when certain patterns are detected. For instance, if the input contains the word "sad," ELIZA might respond with something like "Why do you feel sad?" This technique is known as **keyword detection and response**.
> 
> 3. **Rephrasing**: ELIZA often uses a technique called **direct mirroring**, where it rephrases the user's statements. If a user says, "I am worried about my exams," ELIZA might respond with, "Why are you worried about your exams?" This method helps create the illusion of understanding and engagement.
> 
> 4. **Rules-Based System**: ELIZA operates on a set of rules that dictate how to respond to various inputs. These rules are defined by the programmer and can include various conversational strategies, such as asking questions, reflecting feelings, or providing vague responses that encourage further dialogue.
> 
> 5. **No Learning or Understanding**: It's important to note that ELIZA does not learn from interactions or understand the context of conversations. It simply follows its programmed rules to generate responses based on the input it receives.
> 
> Overall, ELIZA's charm lies in its ability to create a semblance of conversation through clever use of pattern matching and response generation, even though it lacks true comprehension of the dialogue. If you have any specific aspects of ELIZA you'd like to explore further, feel free to ask!

## Defining Artificial Intelligence

- Goal: mimic human intelligence
- Intelligence: understand -> learn -> decide
- AI: process vast data -> learn patterns -> make informed decisions
- Create systems capable of performing tasks requiring intelligence when done by humans:
	- recognizing patterns
	- speech recognition
	- decision making
	- making predictions
- Example: AI that analyzes user preferences and make recommendations

## AI in society

- Very integrated
	- **Auto-tagging** in social media.
	- **Fraud detection** in banking.
	- **Recommendation systems** in music playlists or online shopping.
	- **Smart thermostats** adjusting temperatures.
	- **Ride-sharing apps** optimizing routes and prices.
	- **Wearable devices** monitoring health metrics.
	- **Auto complete** in searching
- AI ethics:
	- What computers learn
	- How they learn it
- Ensuring AI is fair, unbiased, and respects human rights, equity, and privacy is crucial for societal benefit.

## Alexa

- Advertisement time!
- Alexa is an AI-powered virtual assistant housed in an Amazon Echo Dot device. Alexa can:
	- Understand and process voice commands.
	- Make informed decisions.
	- Learn from user interactions to improve its responses over time.
- Alexa uses AI to:
	1. Recognize speech patterns.
	2. Understand context.
	3. Predict user preferences for personalized content.

## Responsible AI

- **Definition**: Responsible AI focuses on creating AI systems that are fair, safe, transparent, and under human control.
- **Importance**: As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, ensuring it makes fair decisions and protects personal data is crucial.
- **Key Dimensions of Responsible AI**:
	  1. **Fairness**: AI should treat everyone equally and avoid discrimination.
	  2. **Explainability**: AI should be able to explain its decisions clearly.
	  3. **Privacy & Security**: AI must protect users' personal data and ensure its security.
	  4. **Transparency**: AI should openly share how it works, its capabilities, and limitations.
	  5. **Robustness**: AI should function effectively even in unpredictable situations.
	  6. **Governance**: AI must adhere to ethical standards and regulations.
	  7. **Safety**: AI should be designed to prevent harm to individuals and the environment.
	  8. **Controllability**: Humans should maintain control over AI systems.
- **Call to Action**: As future AI creators, individuals should prioritize these dimensions to build AI systems that benefit everyone.
