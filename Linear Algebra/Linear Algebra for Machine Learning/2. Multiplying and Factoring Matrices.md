## Key Factorizations of Matrices

- $A = LU$ 
	- L: lower triangular
	- U: upper triangular
	- elimination for solving linear systems
- $A = QR$ 
	- Q: an orthogonal matrix, whose columns are orthonormal
	- **Gram-Schmidt**
- $S = Q\Lambda Q^T$ 
	- S: a symmetric matrix
	- $\Lambda$: a diagonal eigenvalue matrix
		- The eigenvalues are all real
	- Q: normalized eigenvectors (unit vectors)
		- [Orthonormal](Orthonormal%20Vectors.md) eigenvectors, multiplication of two eigenvectors gives 0
	-  $S = (Q\Lambda)Q^T$ 
		- Spectral theorem: S can be broken down to a sum of rank 1 matrices, each being symmetric 
		- Proof: $Sq_1=\lambda_1q_1$
- $A=X\Lambda X^{-1}$ 
	- Diagonalization
	- A: n by n with n independent eigenvectors
	- X: eigenvectors of A as the columns
	- $\Lambda$: eigenvalues of A on the diagonal
- $A = U\Sigma V^T$
	- *Singular value decomposition*: very important in science
	- U and V are orthogonal matrices
	- $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix   
	- Works for every matrix

## A different view of $A=LU$

- See video
- First split A into sum of two rank 1 matrices
	- 1st one: contains column 1 and row 1 of A
	- 2nd one: contains column 2 and row 2 of the rest
	- ...
	- Last one: the rest
- Each rank 1 matrix is $l_nu_n^T$ 

## The fundamental theorem of linear algebra

- Four fundamental subspaces of A, $m*n$, rank r

### Column Space $C(A)$

- dim = r

### Row Space $C(A^T)$

- dim = r

### Null Space $N(A)$

- All solutions to $Ax=0$
- The null space is closed
	- If x is in the null space, y is in the null space, x+y is in the null space
	- If x is in the null space, cx is also in the null space
- dim = n-r
	- why
		- x has n components
		- r independent constraints, i.e. $x_1$ to $x_r$ are fixed 
		- n-r free solutions
	- The number of unique solutions to Ax=0
	- The number of independent vectors in the null space

### Null Space $N(A^T)$

- dim = m-r

### Relationship

- $C(A^T)$ and $N(A)$ are both in $R^n$ space
	- dim of $C(A^T)$ and $N(A)$ add up to n
- $C(A)$ and $N(A^T)$ are both in $R^m$ space
	-  dim of $C(A)$ and $N(A^T)$ add up to m

### Geometry

- $C(A^T)$ and $N(A)$ 
	- Row space and null space are [Orthogonal](Orthogonal%20Spaces.md) to each other
	- Because rows of A are [orthogonal](Orthogonal%20Vectors.md) to columns of $N(A)$
		- In $Ax=0$, we know that each row of $A$ dots $x$ gives 0. So every vector in the row space of A is [Orthogonal](Orthogonal%20Vectors.md) to each vector in the null space. We then conclude the row space and the null space are orthogonal to each other.
- $C(A)$ and $N(A^T)$
	- Column space and null space of $A^T$ are orthogonal to each other
	- Rows of $A^T$ are orthogonal to columns of $N(A^T)$
	- $N(A^T)$ is also called the _left null space_
