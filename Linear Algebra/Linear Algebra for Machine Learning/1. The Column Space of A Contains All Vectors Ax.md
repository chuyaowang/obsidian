## Matrix multiplication Ax

- A is a matrix, x is a vector
- One way: *dot product* of each row of A and x
- Another (better) way: linear combination of columns of A by the column elements of x
	- i.e.: x1\*col1 + x2\*col2 + x3\*col3
- Creates a vector from linear combination of columns

## Column space

- By taking all possible xs, get all combination of columns of A: $C(A)$
- $C(A)$ can be a space, a dimension, or a line when A is a 3\*3 matrix
- **Column Rank** of A is the dimension of the column space, also the *number of independent columns*
	- Rank 1: $C(A)$ is a line
	- Rank 2: $C(A)$ is a plane
	- Rank 3: $C(A)$ is a space

## Basis of Column Space

- **Basis** of $C(A)$: the independent columns of A
- Going from left to right, take each independent column
- $A = CR$
	- Factorization of A into C and R
	- C: the basis of column space
	- R: the basis of row space, transforms C into A
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Important</mark>: **Rank of R (row rank) equals to Rank of C (column rank)**

## Row Space

- All combination of rows of A
- Column space of A<sup>T</sup>, C(A<sup>T</sup>)
- Columns of C are the *basis of the column space*
- Rows of R are the *basis of the row space*
	- Proof: rows are independent and produce the rows of A
- R: the **range** of A, also the row reduced echelon form of A
### Yet another way for matrix multiplication

- Linear combinations of the rows of R by the row elements of C
- The backward way

## Sampling a matrix

- For a very large matrix, columns need to be sampled to analyze
- Sampling columns with Ax, where x=rand(m,1)

## A=CUR

- Another way to factor A. 
- In $A=CR$, C contains real columns from A
- In $A=CUR$, R contains real rows of A
- R: actual rows of A
- U: transforms R

## Multiplication of A and B

- Beginners: row · column
- Good way: sum of columns of A \* rows of B, sum of outer products
	- Each column of A\*row of B creates a m\*p matrix
	- The product is the sum of these matrices

## Cost of multiplication

- Multiplication of (m⨉n) and (n⨉p)
- Beginner way: mnp calculations
- Good way: nmp calculations
- Why the good way then?
	- It turns AB into a sum of rank 1 matrices $uv^T$s
	- **A dominant theme in applied linear algebra:** factor $A$ into $CR$ and look at the pieces $c_kr_k$ of $A=CR$
