# Singular Matrix

## Definition

A matrix is singular if its [determinant](Determinant.md) is 0.

## Properties

- A singular matrix is **non-invertible**. See [Inverse matrices](3.%20Multiplication%20and%20Inverse%20Matrices.md#Inverse%20matrices).
- A singular matrix has linear dependent columns and rows.
	- Hence linear combinations of the columns of a singular matrix can be 0.
