## Differences

In mathematics, the inner product and the outer product are two different operations that can be performed on vectors. The inner product takes two vectors and returns a scalar, while the outer product takes two vectors and returns a matrix.

The inner product of two vectors is defined as the dot product of the vectors. The dot product is calculated by multiplying the corresponding components of the vectors and then adding the products together. The inner product of two vectors is often used to measure the similarity between the vectors.

The outer product of two vectors is defined as the tensor product of the vectors. The tensor product is calculated by multiplying each component of the first vector by each component of the second vector and then adding the products together. The outer product of two vectors is often used to create a new vector that is perpendicular to both of the original vectors.
