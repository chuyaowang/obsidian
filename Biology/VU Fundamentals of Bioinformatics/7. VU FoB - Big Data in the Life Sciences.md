# Big Data in the Life Sciences

[0. VU FoB](0.%20VU%20FoB.md)

## Human Genome Project

The first global collaborative and inter- disciplinary life science project with big data exchange via the internet. 1990-2003

Competition of academia vs. Celera

Craig Ventor

Jim Kent: GigAssembler to assemble genomes

## Next Generation Sequencing

Longer and longer read lengths.

## Bioinformatics is a fast-changing field

Changes all the time
- New measurement techniques  
- New data time and again  
- New technology, formats, standards, hypes  
- New insights  

**20 years ago**: hotspots â€“ highly conserved regions of DNA without known (protein coding) function  

**Now**: Regions coding for functional RNAs, e.g. miRNA  
- miRNAs knock down expression of genes by interfering (hybridization) with mRNA  
- A whole new layer of network between DNA and protein  

## The main challenge

The data plethora: lots of data are generating

Most databases grow exponentially:
- EMBL: nucleotide database
- Protein databases
- Literature

Data amount is growing faster than available storage:
- Compress data
- Delete primary data

The champion of data storage: **DNA**
- very stable
- 1 yotta byte in a gram of DNA
	- 1 yottabyte = $10^{24}$ bytes
	- 1 zettabyte = $10^{21}$ bytes
- reading the DNA is easy with modern sequencing technology, writing the data is challenging. DNA must be synthesized in the right order.

## Big data today

### Applications

- Weather prediction
- Predicting spread of disease
- Large-scale surveillance
- Finding subatomic particles (Higgs boson)
- fan reaction analysis for artists

### Data integration is challenging

Problems:
- Non-integrating data: data from different sources are challenging to integrate.
- No common standards
- No common tool to access the data

### Steven Keating

- Neuroscientist who tried to study his own brain cancer.
- Pushed for patient access to their own data. 
- ðŸ‘» in 2019

### Dirk - Jan van der Pol

- Got thymus cancer and COPD
- Also tried to study his own disease
- Accessing his own data was difficult

## Data Interoperability

### Semantic web

[Linked open data](https://lod-cloud.net/clouds/lod-cloud.svg)

Enables data interoperability.

The data triple: the subject, the predicate (the relation), the object
- \\<Protein A\> \<Interacts with\> \<Protein B\>
- \\<Protein A\> \<Located in\> \<Cell A\>

### Ontology


### Gene Ontology


### Ontology matching

- Match ontology from different fields

## Data Stewardship

FAIR data: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable

### Findable:  

F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier  
F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)  
F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes  
F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource  

### Accessible:  

A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications  
protocol  
A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable  
A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where  
necessary  
A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available  

### Interoperable:  

I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for  
knowledge representation.  
I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles  
I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data  

### Reusable:  

R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes  
R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license  
R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance  
R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

### Data stewardship - process overview

- Plan
- Management
- Long-term preservation

### FAIR data resource

Datasets expressed using one of the prescribed standards of the FAIR Data Protocol. 

The original dataset is transformed into a _FAIR format_ and proper **metadata** and **license** are added to produce a FAIR Data Resource.  

Original and the FAIR version can co-exist, each one fulfilling its own purpose.
