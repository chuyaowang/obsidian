[0. VU FoB](0.%20VU%20FoB.md)

> [!summary] Single Nuclear Variant
> A DNA sequence variation that occurs when a single nucleotide (adenine, thymine, cytosine, or guanine) in the genome sequence is altered. Single nucleotide variants may be rare or common in a population. Sometimes single nucleotide variants are referred to as single nucleotide polymorphisms if they are present in at least 1% of the population. Also called SNV.

## Examples

- Rare disorders: find genetic causes of rare disorder
- GLUT transporter: find if mutation causes GLUT dysfunction
- A mutation may not have impact on the system if there are redundant pathways or proteins to replace its function.
- Biology is complex!

- The dataset available is not always balanced.
	- Need to upsample the minority class or downsample the majority class
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Classification vs. regression
- Feature selection: choose important features pertinent to the dependent variable.
	- Choose the features that correlate well with the dependent variable and orthogonal with each other
	- Simpler and computationally less demanding
	- Help to make a model more interpretable

### SIFT

- First generation VEP
- Position specific
- Based on the assumption that variation in highly conserved regions will cause functional changes and be deleterious.
- Position with high degree of diversity across species will be neutral towards mutations.

### PolyPhen2

Several assumptions:
- variation in highly conserved aa with cause functional changes
- aa variation affecting solubility stability, interaction and active side are likely to affect protein structure
- change in protein structure likely to change function

PolyPhen2 vs. PolyPhen: Naive bayes, different features
#### Mendelian vs. complex disease

Complex diseases are caused by multiple mutations

- Detecting new metabolic disease pathways

#### HumDiv vs. HumVar

HumDiv for mendelian
HumVar for complex diseases

changes in closely related homologs (chimpanzees or cows):
	note that proteins may have different impacts in different species.
