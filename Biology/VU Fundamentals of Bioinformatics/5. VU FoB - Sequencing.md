# Sequencing

[0. VU FoB](0.%20VU%20FoB.md)

## Sanger sequencing


## Illumina sequencing

Short sequencing technique

1. Library preparation
2. Cluster amplification
3. Sequencing by synthesis

## Oxford Nanopore Sequencing

Long sequencing technique

## Terminology

- Reads: small fragments of sequence
- Sequencing depth: how many times a nucleotide is sequenced.
- Sequencing coverage: how much of the original sequence is sequenced.

## De Bruijn graphs of sequence aligment

After sequencing, reads are aligned to the reference genome.

What happens if no access to reference genome?

The seven bridges of Konigsberg: if there a paths through the city that cross all 7 bridges.

Finding an Eulerian path through the bridges requires graph theory.

The De Bruijn Graph finds a path through the $k-1$ mers.

Repeats lead to errors and ambiguity.
- Extend length of k-mers
- Compare coverage of divergent alignments
- Use long sequencing techniques
