# Protein Structure and Sequence Profiles

[0. VU FoB](0.%20VU%20FoB.md)

## Protein structure

- Primary: amino acid sequence
- Secondary: $\alpha$-helix, $\beta$-sheets
	- Due to hydrogen bonding between N-H and C=O groups in the polypeptide backbone
- Tertiary: folding
	- Happens because hydrophobic effects.
	- Due the side chains
- Quaternary: combination of tertiary structures.

## Sequence profiles

- Sequence logo: frequency of amino acids at each position.
	- more frequent amino acids have larger letters. Multiple amino acids are scaled to their frequency.
	- total height means information in bits (more important to know).
- Selection happens at the level of function, function depends on structure. Structure is determined by sequence.
	- Function conservation is the most important. 
	- Structure and sequence can change, as long as the function remains the same.
