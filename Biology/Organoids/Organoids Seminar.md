## *Hydrogels* emulate the extracellular matrix for unbiased in vivo and in vitro *organoid formation and drug testing* 

> Alexander Baker, phD at U of Toronto

- Hyaluronan hydrogels are made for 3d cell culture by reacting with oxime.
- Oxime hydrogels preserve signaling pathways:
	- Compared pathway activated by different materials.
- Stable dynamic hydrogels to recapitulate the ECM: cells need to be able to remodel the material.
- Polarization is dependent on laminin.
- Hydrogel composition affects MCF-10A gene expression: HA+Collagen, HA+laminin, Matrigel.
- Organoids formed in the HA hydrogels.
- In vitro response to therapeutics is hydrogel dependent as cells grow at different rates:
	- Measured cell growth rate.
- Measured immune cell composition in the organoids: reflects immune response.

### Questions

- Response of primary vs. iPSC derived cells might be different.
- DAPI intensity with hyrdrogel + coll or LaM? as DAPI shows chromatin condensation which is defined by stiffness.
- Support for other cell types? Need to test if it works.

## Modeling *human fatty liver diseases* with iPSC-derived organoid

> Yosuke Yoneyama, Institute of Research, Tokyo Medical and Dental University

- NAFLD and NASH cause chronic liver failures, yet no drugs available.
- The pathogenesis is heterogeneous.
- NAFLD has several common genetic risk variants. How they interact is questionable.
- To reflect pathology, the cell organoid should reflect many different cell types.
- Population screening of organoids.
	- Screened for phenotype-genotype interaction in 24 organoids.
	- Found risk variant PNPLA3<sup>GG</sup>, GCKR.

- GCKR mechanism found by gene editing experiments.
	- Opposing effects in NASH with/without diabetes.
- Compared lipid accumulation normal and risk variants in organoids.

### Questions

- Differentiation capacity of iPSCs.
- How genetic factors affect immune cells in the organoids.

## Unravelling the Effects of *Thymidine Analog* 5-Ethynyl-2'-Deoxyuridine on the Cell Cycle of Human Pluripotent Cells

> Osvaldo Contreras Saavedra, Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute

- EdU uptake to study cell cycle, proliferation, and cell fate.
- Thymidine analogues are toxic antimetabolites. They can cause cell cycle arrest, causing necrosis and cell death, but the mechanisms are not well understood.
- EdU is highly toxic to iPSCs and can cause chromosomal stability and death.
- EdU alters the pluripotent stem cell proteome.
- DNA damage can be sensed by western blotting downstream effectors.
- FUCCI single-cell imaging to study cell cycle after introducing EdU.
- EdU impairs MCM<sub>2-7</sub> mediated DNA replication licensing.
