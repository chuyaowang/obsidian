## The Genome

- Genes: codes for proteins
	- Start with ATG
	- Ends with TAA, TAG, TGA
- Regulatory [motif](#^6a1795): controls gene expression
	- TTATA box
	- CGG, CCG
	- TGGGG
- Complementary matching: G matches C; A matches T
- Every turn in the DNA strand is 10.5 nucleotides long

> [!summary] Motif
> A motif is a sequence of nucleotides that are presumed to have a function.

^6a1795

> [!note] Nucleotides
> 
> A and G are purines. C and T are pyrimidines.
> A and G are larger molecules. C and T are smaller molecules.
> A matches T. C matches G.

## Gene Regulation

- [Promoter](Promoter.md): proximal regulatory regions
- Enhancers: distal regulatory regions
- Promoters and enhancers are made of various [motifs](#^6a1795)s
- Enhancers loop around to bind promoters, which recruits transcription machinery
	- There can be multiple bindings to a [promoter](Promoter.md), which act like logic gates for gene regulation
- Other [motif](#^6a1795)s that splice DNA into introns, non-coding regions, and exons, coding regions
- microRNAs: guide RNA splicing, translation, degradation, and stability of mRNA ^ae0496

> [!note] Identifying Regulatory Motifs
> 
> Probabilistic models can be used to identify genes that are regulated by a given [transcription factor](Transcription%20Factor.md). 
> 
> For example, given the set of motifs known to bind a given transcription factor, we can compute the probability that a candidate motif also binds the transcription factor.
> 
> Comparative sequence analysis can also be used to identify regulatory motifs, since regulatory motifs show characteristic patterns of **evolutionary conservation**.

## Central Dogma

- DNA makes RNA makes Protein
- Phosphate backbone
	- 3 H-bond between C and G
	- 2 H-bonds between A and T

## Epigenomics

- Epigenomics: external regulatory mechanisms
- DNA in densely folded: strand, **nucleosome**, **chromatin** fiber, chromosome, condensed chromosome, whole mitotic chromosome
- DNA must be unpacked to be transcribed
- Modification on the chromatin structure regulates gene expression
- Different epigenetic regulations determine what genes are utilized in each cell type, known as **epigenetic memory**.

### DNA methylation

- Methyl group (an **epigenetic factor**) can tag DNA and activate or repress genes

### Histone modifications

- Histones are proteins around which DNA can wind for compaction and gene regulation
- Epigenomic modifications can post-translationally change histone proteins that hold the proteins together
- 147 base pairs wrapped around each nucleosome, which is made of 8 histone proteins
- Each histone protein has a long AA tail that can undergo modifications by binding to epigenetic factors

> [!note]- Histone Code
> 1. **Acetylation**: Acetylation of histones, particularly at lysine residues, generally relaxes chromatin structure, making it more accessible to transcription factors and RNA polymerase. This modification is associated with active gene expression.
>     
> 2. **Methylation**: Methylation can either activate or repress gene expression, depending on the specific lysine or arginine residue that is methylated and the degree of methylation. For example, methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4) is associated with active transcription, while methylation of H3K9 and H3K27 is generally linked to gene repression.
>     
> 3. **Phosphorylation**: Phosphorylation of histones can regulate their interactions with other proteins and affect chromatin structure. It often occurs in response to [cell signaling](Cell%20Signaling.md) pathways and can either activate or repress gene expression, depending on the context.
>     
> 4. **Ubiquitination**: Ubiquitination of histones can lead to either activation or repression of gene expression, depending on the specific histone residue that is modified and the context in which it occurs.
>     
> 5. **Sumoylation**: Sumoylation involves the attachment of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) proteins to histones and can regulate various chromatin processes, including transcriptional activation and repression.
>     
> 6. **ADP-ribosylation**: ADP-ribosylation involves the addition of ADP-ribose groups to histones and can modulate chromatin structure and gene expression.
> 
> These modifications, often referred to as the "histone code," collectively influence chromatin structure and accessibility, thereby regulating gene expression. The interplay between different histone modifications, as well as their interactions with other chromatin-associated proteins, forms a complex regulatory network that governs gene expression in cells.

## RNA

- One stranded
- Can form double strands by binding to itself
- Coding for proteins and other functions
- Gene regulation

> [!note] RNAs in Central Dogma
> 1. [**mRNA**](mRNA.md) (messenger RNA) contains the information to make a protein and is translated into protein sequence.
> 2. [**tRNA**](tRNA.md) (transfer RNA) speciﬁes codon-to-amino-acid translation. It contains a 3 base pair anti-codon complementary to a codon on the mRNA, and carries the amino acid corresponding to its anticodon attached to its 3’ end.
> 3. **rRNA** (ribosomal RNA) forms the core of the ribosome, the organelle responsible for the translation of mRNA to protein.
> 4. **snRNA** (small nuclear RNA) is involved in splicing (removing introns from) pre- mRNA, as well as other functions.
> 5. [**microRNA**](microRNA.md)(micro RNA) is involved in regulation of post transcriptional gene expression.

## Proteins

- Translated from mRNAs using adaptor molecules called tRNA
- Proteins regulates DNA and RNA

## Mutations

- Act on DNA, RNA, and proteins to affect expression
