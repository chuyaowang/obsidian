## Data Structures 

Different ways to organize data such as variables, arrays, hashes, and objects.

## Linear Data Structures

- **Definition**: Sequence and order are crucial; must traverse items sequentially.
- **Examples**: Arrays and linked lists.

## Non-Linear Data Structures

- **Definition**: Items can be arranged non-sequentially.
- **Examples**: [Hash Table](Hash%20Table.md) (dictionaries), trees, and graphs.

## Memory Management

- **Arrays**: Require contiguous memory blocks.
- **Linked Lists**: Do not need contiguous memory; memory can be scattered.

## Static vs. Dynamic Data Structures

- **Static (Arrays)**: Fixed size; requires contiguous memory.
- **Dynamic (Linked Lists)**: Can grow and shrink; memory allocation is flexible.

## Parts of a Linked List

- **Nodes**: Basic elements containing data and a reference to the next node.
- **Head**: Reference to the first node.
- **Tail**: Last node, points to null.

## Types of Linked Lists

- **Singly Linked List**: Nodes point to the next node only.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Nodes have references to both the next and previous nodes.
- **Circular Linked List**: Last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.

## Advantages of Linked Lists

- **Memory Efficiency**: No need for contiguous memory.
- **Dynamic Size**: Can grow and shrink as needed.
