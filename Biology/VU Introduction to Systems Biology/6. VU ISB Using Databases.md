# Using Databases

## EcoCyc

Proteins, genes, pathways
Link to reactions using [E.C. Number](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#E.C.%20Number)

## Uniprot

Protein structures, catalyzed reactions, protein sequence

## BRENDA

Enzymes with KMs (kinetics constant)

## BLAST

Align two protein sequences. 
Find the same protein in different organisms.

## How sequence affects enzymes

Enzymes catalyzing the same reaction can have different structures.
Enzymes that are similar can catalyze different reactions.

Different in protein sequence affect enzyme kinetics. Enzyme kinetics in different organisms are different: not the same reaction speed.
Enzymes are not accounted for in [Stoichiometric model of metabolism](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#Stoichiometric%20model%20of%20metabolism)
