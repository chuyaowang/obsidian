1. Why is this expression meaningless? $$\max_{\mathbf{v}}\{v_{1}|\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0}\}$$
	1. The solution space is not bound. $v_1$ can be as high as it gets.
2. Why is this expression meaningless? $$\max_{\mathbf{v}}\{v_{1}|\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0},v_{2}>10\}$$
	1. The solution space is still not bound. $v_2$ can be infinite.
3. What is the value of $v_2$ when the value of $v_1$ is finite in the linear program? $$\max_\mathbf{v}\{v_1|\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0},v_2<10\}$$
	1. If $v_1$ is finite and $v_2 < 10$, $v_2$ is limiting $v_1$. So $v_2$ must have hit its upper bound. Hence, $v_2$ is 10.
4.  What is the value of $v_2$ when the value of $v_1$ is infinite in the linear program? $$\max_\mathbf{v}\{v_1|\mathbf{S}\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{0},v_2<10\}$$
	1. Minus infinity?
	2. $v_1$ independent of $v_2$, $v_2$ can be any value.
