## A non-trivial example of metabolic network

A network of E. Coli.

Evolutionarily, organisms are selected for producing the highest biomass.

In real applications, engineers want to optimize for other products, like amino acids.

Optimizing for another product is equivalent to choosing another solution to reach flux [Steady state](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#Steady%20state). To do it in real life, you remove the genes associated with other solutions and leave only one available solution. An easier way is to limit the available nutrient input to limit to the desired solution. Another way is laboratory evolution. When the bacteria produce the desired output, reward it with more nutrient. This way the bacteria evolves to optimize the production of the output.

## Flux Balance Analysis

Most of the time in real life, we do not have [the number of fluxes needed to solve the equations](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#Determine%20the%20number%20of%20fluxes%20needed%20to%20solve%20the%20equations). A method to solve $\boldsymbol{Sv}=\boldsymbol{0}$ using ==linear optimization== is used.
- Find the best solution in the solution space according to the constraint and the objective
- Constraint: the solution should follow these constraints
	- **Steady state constraint**: imposed by the equations from the [Stoichiometric matrix](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#Stoichiometric%20matrix) to impose _mass balance_
	- **Flux capacity constraint**: inequalities for each flux setting _upper and lower bounds_
- Objective: 
	- such as maximizing the production of leucine
	- the optimal solution is the one that meets the objective in the solution space defined by the constraints.

### Convention

Import and export reactions are labeled as `EX_glyc`, for example.
Import reactions are **negative**, export reactions are **positive**.
For a reactant, if an arrow comes from the top or the left, the convention is to treat these reactions as making the reactant.
### Questions

- Why setting GDH to 0 does not work?
	- GDH converts NADH back to NAD+.
	- Another reaction that converts NADH to NAD+ is ADH, a part of the ethanol synthesis pathway.
	- When you set GDH reaction to 0 and optimize for growth, all pyruvate are used in the growth reaction and none is used for making ethanol. So no reaction can convert
