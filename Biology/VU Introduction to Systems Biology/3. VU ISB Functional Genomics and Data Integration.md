## Genome annotation

The genome sequence needs to be annotated for information.

> [!summary]- Genome Annotation
> **Genome annotation** is the process of finding and designating locations of individual genes and other features on raw DNA sequences, called **assemblies**. Annotation gives meaning to a given sequence and makes it much easier for researchers to view and analyze its contents.

> [!summary]- Functional Genomics
> Functional genomics is the study of how genes and intergenic regions of the genome contribute to different biological processes. A researcher in this field typically studies genes or regions on a “genome-wide” scale (i.e. all or multiple genes/regions at the same time), with the hope of narrowing them down to a list of candidate genes or regions to analyze in more detail. 
> 
> The goal of functional genomics is to determine how the individual components of a biological system _work together_ to produce a particular phenotype. 
> 
> Functional genomics focuses on the dynamic expression of gene products in a _specific context_, for example, at a specific developmental stage or during a disease. 
> 
> In functional genomics, we try to use our current knowledge of gene function to develop _a model linking genotype to phenotype_. There are several specific functional genomics approaches depending on what we are focused on:  
> - DNA level (genomics and epigenomics)
> - RNA level (transcriptomics)
> - Protein level (proteomics)
> - Metabolite level (metabolomics)

### Annotate a gene means

- Finding the start and end sites of a gene
	- By looking at the amino acids in the protein
- Identify RNA polymerase binding sites, [Transcription Factor](Transcription%20Factor.md) finding sites per gene
- Identity the function of the protein that is encoded by the gene, by its homology to annotated genes in other organisms
- per protein:
	- strength of ribosome binding site of its mRNA
	- find its binding partner(proteins, small molecules)
	- the reaction it catalyzes
	- the cellular function it is involved in: e,g, metabolism, signaling, stress, gene regulation, transcription, translation, etc.

### Function of a gene is determined from

- The gene sequences homology with a gene in another organism, where the function of the gene is known from experiments
- Using for instance 'BLAST', an algorithm for sequence alignment and similarity/homology detection
- The genes being compared to still needs to be annotated experimentally.

### Experiment underlies the functional determination of a gene

- Levels
	- Gene: transcription
	- mRNA; translation
	- protein: structure (uniprot), function
	- reactions: biochemical quantification of **reaction rate equation**.

	- This reaction is a part of the metabolic network

### Example: glk gene


## Metabolic Network

### Metabolic network

- It is sparse: most molecules only have a few connections. Some molecules, like ATP, are involved in many reactions. [Power Law](Power%20Law.md)
- The aim of metabolic network: use nutrients to double the cell. All molecules are doubled in one generation.
	- Make these: inorganic ions, small molecules, phospholipids, DNA, RNA, protein, polysaccharide
	- The macromolecules of a cell are made from building blocks and energy

## Genome annotation: from genome to biological function with universal principles

![](Pasted%20image%2020240919150112.png)

- The principles work both ways. For example, we know how to go from DNA to unfolded protein and back, but the other principles are not really understood both ways yet.
- Unfolded protein to folded protein: ALPHAFOLD, but not mechanistic understanding.
- Protein folding to function: few data to train a good model.
	- ALPHAFOLD bad with membrane proteins due to lack of crystallography data.
