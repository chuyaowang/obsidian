# Introduction

## Scales of biology

- Size scale: Molecule, Cell, Tissue, Organ
- Time scale:
- Events happening at different time scales within the same reaction: $$2H_{2}O+2NADP+3ADP+3Pi+light\rightarrow 2 NADPH + 2H+ 3ATP+ O_{2}$$
	- Light absorption and excitation ($10^{-15} - 10^{-12}s$)
	- Energy transfer within the antenna complex ($10^{-12}s$)
	- Water splitting and oxygen evolution ($10^{-3}s$)
- Important for problems with different scales: **units**

### Exercise

- Mass: M; length: L; time: T
- The units of the followings are:
- Surface density of neurons in brain: $\frac{M}{L^2}$
- Concentration of sugar in milkshake: $\frac{M}{L^{3}}$
- Volumetric pumping rate of heart: $\frac{L^{3}}{T}$

### This course

- Check if a reaction _can occur_
- Model how reactions proceed with _time_
- Probe how _reaction kinetics_ can be altered

## Spontaneity

- For time scale to exist, things need to happen
- Conservation of energy: energy can neither be created nor destroyed
- How can we predict if things can happen? **energy**

### Tree pillars of spontaneity

- Change in entropy:  $\Delta S,\frac{J}{mol\cdot K}$ 
	- [Entropy](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/8.%20VU%20SB%20Folding%20and%20Thermodynamics.md#Entropy)
- Enthalpy: $\Delta H,\frac{kJ}{mol}$
	- both the internal energy and the work done by the system against external pressure
- $\Delta G=\Delta H-T\Delta S, \frac{kJ}{mol}$
	- A thermodynamic potential that measures the maximum reversible work done by a thermodynamic system at constant temperature and pressure.
	- If $\Delta G<0$, spontaneous
	- $\Delta G>0$, not spontaneous
	- $\Delta G=0$, [equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc)

### Exercise: is a reaction spontaneous?

Question:

$$
\begin{align}
CH_{4}+2O_{2}&\rightarrow CO_{2}+2H_{2}O\\
\Delta H(CH_{4})&=-74.8 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
\Delta H(O_{2})&=0\frac{kJ}{mol} \\
\Delta H(CO_{2}) & =-393.5 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
\Delta H(H_{2}O) & =-285.8 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
\Delta S(CH_{4})&=186.3 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K} \\
\Delta S(O_{2})&=205.2\frac{J}{mol\cdot K} \\
\Delta S(CO_{2}) & =213.8 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K} \\
\Delta S(H_{2}O) & =69.9 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K} \\
\end{align}
$$

Approach:

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta H&=\sum \Delta H_{\text{products}}-\sum\Delta H_{\text{substrates}}\\
\Delta S&=\sum \Delta S_{\text{products}}-\sum\Delta S_{\text{substrates}}\\
\Delta G&=\Delta H-T\Delta S\\
\Delta G&<0 \Rightarrow \text{spontaneous}
\end{align}
$$

Calculation:

$$
\begin{align}
\Delta H&=(-393.5-2\times 285.8)-(-74.8+2 \times 0)=-890.3 \frac{kJ}{mol} \\
\Delta S&=(213.8+2\times 69.9)-(186.3+2\times 205.2)=-243.1 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K} \\
\Delta G&=-890.3 \frac{kJ}{mol}\times 10^{3} + 298 K\times 243.1 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K}=-817856.2 \frac{J}{mol\cdot K}
\end{align}
$$

## Law of mass action

### Consider a reaction

- $\text{Red}+\text{Blue}\rightarrow \text{Green}$
	- An irreversible reaction. The concentration of green depends on the concentration of red and blue
- $\text{Red}+\text{Blue}\leftrightarrow \text{Green}$
	- The concentration of red and blue depends on the rate of dissociation of green
- At some point, they reach an [equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc) state
- [Equilibrium constants](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Equilibrium%20constants): $K_{c}=\frac{[\text{Green}]}{\text{[Red]}\text{[Blue]}}=\frac{p}{s}$
- The equilibrium constant is associated with Gibbs free energy: $\Delta G=-RT\ln(K_{c})$
- See also [3. VU BMBN Mass Action Kinetics and Models of State Transition Diagrams](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/3.%20VU%20BMBN%20Mass%20Action%20Kinetics%20and%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagrams.md), [Equilibrium constant interpretations](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/8.%20VU%20BMBN%20General%20Form%20of%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Equilibrium%20constant%20interpretations)

### Minor twist

- $\text{Red}+2\text{Blue} \leftrightharpoons \text{Green}$
- $K_{eq}=\frac{[\text{Green}]}{\text{[Red]}\text{[Blue]}^{2}}$
- [Summary: when to take products and when to take sums](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/14.%20VU%20BMBN%20Question%20Hour.md#Summary%20when%20to%20take%20products%20and%20when%20to%20take%20sums)

### Rate of reactions

- The rate of reaction is proportional to the probability of a collision of the reactants
- See general form at [Principle of mass action kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/3.%20VU%20BMBN%20Mass%20Action%20Kinetics%20and%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagrams.md#Principle%20of%20mass%20action%20kinetics)
- At the equilibrium state, the forward rate = reverse rate
$$
\begin{align}
r_{f}&=r_{r} \\
r & =0 \\
k_{f}\prod_{i}S_{i}^{m_{i}}&=k_{r}\prod_{j}P_{j}^{m_{j}} \\
K_{c} & =\frac{k_{f}}{k_{r}}=\left[ \frac{\prod_{j}P_{j}^{m_{j}}}{\prod_{i}S_{i}^{m_{i}}} \right]_{eq}
\end{align}
$$
- Similar derivation at [The Haldane relationship](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#The%20Haldane%20relationship) for enzyme kinetics

### Unit balance

- Reaction rate: $\frac{M}{s}$ or $\frac{\text{concentration}}{\text{time}}$
- Concentration: $M=\frac{mol}{L}$
- The unit of $K_{c}$ depends on the specific reaction to make the units balance

### Differential equation

- For a first order reaction $a\rightarrow b$
- $\frac{dS_{a}}{dt}=-r_{f}=-kS_{a}$
- Integrating over time to get concentration vs. time curve

$$
\begin{align}
\int_{S_{0}}^S\frac{dS_{a}}{dt}&=\int_{t_{0}}^{t}dt \\
\ln(S)&=-kt+c \\
\ln(S)&=-kt+\ln(S_{0}) \\
S&=S_{0}e^{-kt}
\end{align}
$$
- The concentration decreases exponentially over time
- More examples in [Exercise](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Exercise)

## Catalyst

### Sweeter slow sugar

$$
\underbrace{ C_{12}H_{22}O_{11} }_{ \text{Sucrose} }+H_{2}O\rightarrow \underbrace{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} }_{ \text{Glucose} }+\underbrace{ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} }_{ \text{Fructose} }
$$

$$
r=kS_{su}S_{H_{2}O}
$$
- Since $H_{2}O$ is often in excess, its concentration can be considered constant. This reaction is then a pseudo-first order reaction: 

$$
\begin{align}
r&=k'S_{su} \\
k'&=kS_{H_{2}O} \\
\frac{dS_{su}}{dt}&=-k'S_{su}
\end{align}
$$
- Sucrose hydrolysis in nature takes a long time
- A catalyst speeds up the reaction

### Catalyst speeds up the reaction

- Enzymes speed up the reaction by lowering the activation energy barrier. This makes the reactants more likely to overcome the barrier. The reaction thus becomes faster.
- However, they **do not** change the spontaneity of the reaction, which is determined by [Gibbs free energy](#Tree%20pillars%20of%20spontaneity). 

### Enzyme catalysis

$$
a+E \overset{k_{1}}{\underset{k_{-1}}{\leftrightarrows}} aE \overset{k_{2}}\rightarrow b
$$

### Michaelis-Menten Kinetics

- $r=-\frac{dS_{a}}{dt}=\frac{dS_{b}}{dt}$
- The rate equals to the rate of $a$ being consumed and $b$ being produced
- Assumed $aE \rightarrow b$ is the rate limiting step: $k_{1},k_{-1}\gg k_{2}$
- See also [Binding polynomials](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Binding%20polynomials)

### ODE describing enzyme kinetics

- Quasi-steady state assumption: $S_{E}\ll S_{a}$ and $S_{aE}\ll S_{a}$
	- a is in great excess of both E and aE, so $\frac{dS_{aE}}{dt}$ can be treated as essentially 0
	- See details at [quasi-steady state assumption](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#^c97d87)
- Enzyme conservation: $S_{E,total}=S_{E}+S_{aE}$
	- Total enzyme = free enzyme + aE complex
	- Example: [The quasi-equilibrium approximation for enzyme kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#The%20quasi-equilibrium%20approximation%20for%20enzyme%20kinetics)

### Briggs-Haldane assumption

- Assumes the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex (aE) reaches an steady state during the reaction.
$$
\begin{align}
\left[ \frac{dS_{aE}}{dt} \right]_{\text{formation}}&=k_{1}S_{a}S_{E}=k_{1}S_{a}(S_{E,\text{total}}-S_{aE}) \\
\left[ \frac{dS_{aE}}{dt} \right]_{\text{dissociation}}&=k_{-1}S_{aE}+k_{2}S_{aE}=(k_{-1}+k_{2})S_{aE}
\end{align}
$$
- This is different from the [quasi-equilibrium assumption](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#^cfb872).

### Michaelis-Menten constant

- The Michaelis-Menten constant is obtained by setting them equal

$$
\begin{align}
k_{1}S_{a}(S_{E,\text{total}}-S_{aE})&=(k_{-1}+k_{2})S_{aE}\\
\frac{S_{a}S_{E,\text{total}}}{S_{aE}}-S_{a}&=\frac{k_{-1}+k_{2}}{k_{1}} \\
K_{m}&=\frac{k_{-1}+k_{2}}{k_{1}}=\frac{\text{dissociation}}{\text{association}}
\end{align}
$$
- In the context of enzyme kinetics, $K_{m}$​ is the Michaelis constant. It represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction rate is half of the maximum velocity ($V_{max}$​).

### Maximal velocity

$$\begin{align}
\frac{S_aS_{E,total}}{S_{aE}}-S_a&=K_m \\
\frac{S_aS_{E,total}}{(K_m+S_a)}&=S_{aE} \\
k_{2}\frac{S_{a}S_{E,total}}{(K_{m}+S_{a})}&=k_{2}S_{aE} \\
\end{align}$$

When $S_{a}$ is in great excess. The term $\frac{S_{a}}{K_{m}+S_{a}}$ becomes approximately 1. The equation becomes: 
$$
k_{2}S_{E,total}=k_{2}S_{aE}
$$

This is when all free enzyme becomes $aE$ and the reaction velocity reaches maximum. 

$$
v_{max}=k_2S_{E,total}
$$

- Analogous to $V_{max}=k^+e_{T}$ in [Quick derivation of rapid-equilibrium enzyme kinetics using the binding polynomials of its catalytic and allosteric sites](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Quick%20derivation%20of%20rapid-equilibrium%20enzyme%20kinetics%20using%20the%20binding%20polynomials%20of%20its%20catalytic%20and%20allosteric%20sites)

### Simplified form

$$
\frac{v_{max}S_{a}}{K_{m}+S_{a}}=v
$$


### Inhibition


### Lineweaver-Burke plot

1/concentration vs. 1/v

### Competitive inhibtiion

- Does not alter Michaelis Menten constant

### Non-competitive inhibition

- A and I can bind to E at the same time
