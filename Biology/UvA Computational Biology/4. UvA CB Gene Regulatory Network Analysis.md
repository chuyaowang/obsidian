# Gene regulatory network

## Example

- Non equilibrium steady state
- Ex. glycolysis in muscle cells

## ODE modeling

- Transcription:
	- Rate of mRNA synthesis: production - degradation
	- Why there is always degrading: entropy, degrading from reaction
	- mRNA is regulated by many proteins

$$
\frac{dr_{i}}{dt}=F(f_{i}^R(p_{1}),)
$$

- Translation
	- Rate of protein synthesis = production - degradation

$$
\frac{dp_{i}}{dt}=f_{i}^p(r_{i})-\delta_{i}p_{i}
$$
- Terminology:
	- Activator: promoter
	- Repressor: inhibitor

## The hill function

- Sigmoidal response that reflects biological behavior
- Michaelis menten is n=1

### Activation function

- $\theta$: effector concentration
- $p$: protein concentration
- $n$:
$$
h^+(p_{i},\theta_{i},n_{i})=\frac{p_{i}^{n_{i}}}{p_{i}^{n_{i}}+\theta_{i}^{n_{i}}}
$$
### Inhibition

$$
1-\frac{p_{i}^{n_{i}}}{p_{i}^{n_{i}}+\theta_{i}^{n_{i}}}
$$

### Approximating to step function

- Approximate to piecewise-linear function
- Undefined when $p=\theta$
- Improved PWL function: use a straight line to connect the pieces
$$
L=\begin{cases}
0,&p_{i}<\theta_{i} \\
\mu+v,&p_{i}=\theta_{i} \\

\end{cases}
$$

## Sample GRN

- Negative feedback loop
- draw

### Define the mRNA dynamics

Gene A
- $h^+$: a positive influence
- $m_a$: production rate
- $\gamma$
- $r_{b}$

Gene B
### Protein dynamics

$$
\frac{dp_{i}}{dt}=f_{i}^p(r_{i}-)
$$

- Translation rates
- Law of mass action

### TIme evolution of protein concentrations


### Protein subspace

- pa vs. pb

## Examples

### 1. Lac operon dynamics

- Lactose a step function
- Othe rcencentrations increse afterwatds
- bleu line (repressor prtoein) decreases afterwards
- Lactose inhibtis the repreossr

equations

repressor concentration

-RA term
	R: repressor
	A: allolactose

mRNA concentration

Allolactose concentration

- L: lactose

LacZ concentration

- lactose concentration

### 2. Rperessor vs. allolactose

- Also from lac operon
- High allolactose

take away message:
- use mass action to ocuple two protiens (RA term)

### 3. the repressilator dynamics

- 3 players inhibiting each other
- 1 protein represses 1 mRNA

### 4. Protein subspace plot

- also from repressilator dynamcis

take way message: still a hill function, H- with @t=1
@a is maxmal transcirption rate

### 5. Toggle switch mechanism

botoom plot is zoom in of top
if concnetration goes down, it is brought back up by anotner protein
keeps the concentration constant

simiplifed model

directy modeling protein cocnetration without mRNA.

### 6. Feed forward loop

- Glucose spike: master regulator
- Long activating: takes longer to respond
- Gene response: regulated by long actiating, insulin

keep taking glucose: pulse function becomes linear line
insulin always secreted -> diabetes

model description

$g_{y}$: feedforward, promoting activity, positive hill function
$g_{z}$: depends on $x$ and $y$: multiply two hill functions

### 7. feed forawrd loop

- as master regulatory incereases, target gene increases

### 8. SDEVelo

- Stochastic differentials
- Not smooth plots

## Complete model (revisit)

- Feedback network
- Quasi-steady state assumption
	- mRNA dynamics is faster than protein dynamics
	- mRAN concentration reachs equi than protei nconetration

simpleifed likenar model

steady state assumptions

simplfy protein dynamics

time evolution of protein concentratons: lose osscilations in the biegniing (non stedy state)

prtoein dynamcis: also lose dynamics

## Make use of geometric information

phase line: stable and unstalbe
when dx.dt=0, reaches straedy state
stable vs. unstable 0 points: associated with slopes around the 0 point; push towards or away

## Sample gene network

- solve for stability analysis
- mRNA dynamics
- protein dynamics
- constructing a JAcobian: partial derivative of functio n wrt to different variables
- Take determinants -> eigen values

stability based on eigenvalues
