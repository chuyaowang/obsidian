# Cell Communication

## Cell surface receptor protein

- intracellular signaling pathway, fast (seconds)
- Gene regulation, slow (min to hrs)

## Signaling types

- Endocrine: hormones
- Paracrine: close-range signaling, local mediator
- Contact dependent: surface contact signaling
- Neuronal: neuro-transmitters

### Acetylcholine

- Salivary gland cell
- Skeletal muscle cell contraction
- Hearty muscle cell: decreased rate of force of contraction
- Different effects in different cells

## Receptors

### Cell surface receptors

#### Ion channel coupled receptor



#### G-protein coupled receptors

Activated enzyme
Cyclic AMP
PKA

#### Enzyme coupled receptors

Receptor tyrosine kinases
**Ras protein activates MAP kinase**


### Intracellular receptors: diffuse into the cell and detected by receptors

- Membrane permeable: 
- nitric oxide: smooth muscle relaxation in blood vessel wall; 
	- acetylcholine breaks into arginine and NO, binds to target protein, causes GTP ro transform to cyclic GMP, cause smooth muscle cell relaxation
- cholesterol
- cortisol: diffuse into cell membrane, make contact with receptor, regulates gene expression

### Contact dependent signaling

Notch receptor.
Binding causes part of the receptor to cleave off and go into the nucleus.

## Signal Transduction Cascade

## Molecular Switches

### Protein phosphorylation

- Phosphorylated by kinase
- Removed phosphate with phosphatase

GTP binding


## Bacterial signalling

comK

### Two component system

- Receptor and activator
- Histidine kinase as the receptor, response regulator as the activator

### Chemotaxis

- Bacteria can detect things in the environment and run to or away from it
- Flagella: counter clockwise rotation normally, receive signal, reverse motor direction, cause tumbling, change direction, resumes CCW rotation.

### Magnetotaxis

magnetite filled magnetosome
changes direction with earth's magnetic field.

### Quorum sensing

A quantity must be met for signaling to happen.

Lux operon in Vibrio fischeri (luciferase system)
transcription is activated by high cell density.
AHL gets into the cell
LuxI exports AHL
When there are lots of AHL, AHL binds to the luciferase gene.

Important for genetic competence: genetic material exchange

Also important for biofilm formation:
- Attachment
- Microcolonies
- Mature biofilm
- To make biofilm, bacteria secrete sugar or protein polymers, it only happens when there are enough bacteria nearby

Toxin production: only starts when the quorum is met.
