# Mendelian Diseases

Mendelian diseases, also known as **single-gene disorders**, follow **Mendel's laws of inheritance** (discovered by Gregor Mendel). These diseases are caused by mutations in a single gene and have relatively straightforward inheritance patterns.

## Key Characteristics:

- **Single-gene mutations**: The disease is caused by a mutation in a single gene.
- **Clear inheritance pattern**: These disorders follow predictable inheritance patterns, such as:
  - **Autosomal dominant**: Only one mutated copy of the gene is necessary to cause the disease (e.g., Huntington’s disease).
  - **Autosomal recessive**: Two mutated copies of the gene (one from each parent) are required to cause the disease (e.g., cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia).
  - **X-linked**: The mutation occurs on the X chromosome, with different implications for males and females (e.g., hemophilia).
- **High penetrance**: Individuals who inherit the mutation typically show symptoms of the disease. The genetic mutation almost always leads to disease development.
- **Early onset**: Many Mendelian diseases often manifest early in life, sometimes even at birth or in childhood.

> [!note]- Mendelian diseases are caused by a single gene
> Mendelian diseases are typically caused by mutations in a single gene. In many cases, these diseases are associated with one or more [Single Nucleotide Polymorphism](Single%20Nucleotide%20Polymorphism.md) (SNPs) or [Single Nucleotide Variant](Single%20Nucleotide%20Variant.md) (SNVs), but the exact relationship depends on the specific disease.

> - **Monogenic Mendelian Diseases:** These are typically linked to a specific mutation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the *CFTR* gene, and sickle cell anemia is caused by a specific SNP in the *HBB* gene. In these cases, a single SNP or point mutation can directly lead to the disease.
> 
> - **Multiple SNPs in the Same Gene:** Sometimes, different mutations (SNPs or other types of genetic variants) in the same gene can result in the same or related Mendelian disease phenotypes. For example, different mutations in the *BRCA1* gene can lead to an increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.
> 
> - **Modifier SNPs:** In some cases, additional SNPs elsewhere in the genome may _modify_ the severity or expression of a Mendelian disease. These SNPs are not the primary cause but may influence disease outcomes.

## Examples:

- **Cystic Fibrosis**: Caused by mutations in the **CFTR** gene.
- **Sickle Cell Anemia**: Resulting from mutations in the **HBB** gene.
- **Huntington’s Disease**: An autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the **HTT** gene.
- **Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**: An X-linked disorder caused by mutations in the **DMD** gene.

## Inheritance Patterns:

- **Autosomal Dominant**: If one parent carries the mutation, there’s a 50% chance that the child will inherit the disorder.
- **Autosomal Recessive**: Both parents must carry the mutation for the child to have a 25% chance of inheriting the disorder.
- **X-linked**: In X-linked disorders, males are more frequently affected since they have only one X chromosome, while females can be carriers with mild or no symptoms.
