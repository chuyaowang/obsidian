# SNV

SNV is short for single nucleotide variant. It is a variation of a single nucleotide in a populationâ€™s DNA sequence, or genome. A SNV can be either _common_ or _rare_ and can occur in either germline or somatic cells. SNV occurs in cancer and is key when designing PCR primers meant to detect viruses.

In **non-coding** regions, SNVs can impact mRNA sequence and the level of [Gene Expression Regulation](Gene%20Expression%20Regulation.md) meaning they result in disease susceptibility and can signal a higher risk of cancer. 

SNVs in **coding** regions can be synonymous substitutions or nonsynonymous substitutions. Synonymous substitutions do not alter the amino acid sequence, while nonsynonymous substitutions can be one of two types: missense substitutions result in proteins that are malfunctioning while nonsense substitutions result in prematurely stopped codons.
