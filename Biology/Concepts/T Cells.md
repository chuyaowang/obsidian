# Types of T Cells

## CD4+

CD4+ T cells, also known as helper T cells, express a protein marker called CD4 on their cell surface. These cells play a central role in coordinating and regulating immune responses. CD4+ T cells recognize antigens presented on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (such as macrophages or dendritic cells) through the interaction of their T cell receptor (TCR) and major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules.

Once activated, CD4+ T cells release signaling molecules called cytokines, which help activate other immune cells. They have various subsets, such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and regulatory T cells (Tregs), each with specific functions. Th1 cells secrete cytokines that enhance cellular immunity, while Th2 cells promote antibody production. Th17 cells are involved in inflammatory responses, and Tregs help regulate immune responses to prevent excessive reactions against self-antigens.

Importantly, CD4+ T cells are primarily targeted by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which leads to the depletion of these cells and compromises the immune system.

## CD8+

CD8+ T cells, also known as cytotoxic T cells or killer T cells, express a protein marker called CD8 on their cell surface. These cells are primarily involved in recognizing and eliminating infected or cancerous cells. CD8+ T cells recognize antigens presented on the surface of cells through the interaction of their TCR and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules.

When a CD8+ T cell recognizes an infected or abnormal cell, it becomes activated and releases cytotoxic molecules, such as perforin and granzymes, to induce cell death. This mechanism allows CD8+ T cells to directly kill the target cells, helping to eliminate pathogens or tumor cells.

CD8+ T cells also have memory capabilities, meaning they can "remember" previously encountered antigens. This memory response enables a more rapid and efficient immune response upon re-exposure to the same antigen, providing long-term protection against specific pathogens.

## Subsets

1.  Regulatory T cells (Tregs): Regulatory T cells, marked by the surface marker CD4 and the transcription factor Foxp3, play a crucial role in maintaining immune tolerance and preventing excessive immune responses. Tregs suppress the activation and function of other immune cells, helping to control inflammation and prevent autoimmune reactions.
    
2.  Natural Killer T cells (NKT cells): Natural Killer T cells are a unique subset of T cells that express both T cell receptors (TCRs) and natural killer (NK) cell markers. NKT cells recognize lipid antigens presented by a specialized molecule called CD1d. They have regulatory functions and can rapidly produce cytokines, bridging the innate and adaptive immune responses.
    
3.  Gamma-delta T cells (γδ T cells): Gamma-delta T cells express a distinct type of TCR composed of gamma and delta chains, in contrast to the alpha-beta TCR found on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These T cells are present in tissues such as the skin, intestine, and respiratory tract, and they are involved in early immune responses against infections. They can recognize a wide range of antigens, including stress-induced molecules and specific microbial components.
    
4.  Memory T cells: Memory T cells are long-lived T cells that persist after an initial immune response. Both CD4+ and CD8+ memory T cells are generated following an encounter with an antigen and provide immunological memory. Memory T cells can quickly respond to re-exposure to the same antigen, mounting a more rapid and robust immune response compared to naive T cells. This enables a faster clearance of pathogens and provides long-term immunity.
    
5.  Follicular helper T cells (Tfh cells): Follicular helper T cells are a subset of CD4+ T cells that migrate to germinal centers within lymphoid organs, such as lymph nodes and spleen. Tfh cells provide critical help to B cells in the production of high-affinity antibodies during the germinal center reaction. They play a vital role in the generation of long-lasting humoral immunity.
