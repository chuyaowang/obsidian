## Overview

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that play important regulatory roles in gene expression. They are found in many organisms, including plants, animals, and even some viruses. MiRNAs are typically composed of approximately 21-23 nucleotides and are involved in **post-transcriptional gene regulation**.

miRNA or [siRNA](Small%20Interfering%20RNA.md) can induce degradation of [mRNA](mRNA.md) by forming a RNA-protein complex called **RNA-induced silencing complex** (RISC) with the Argonaute protein.

The biogenesis of miRNAs begins in the nucleus, where they are transcribed from DNA by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The resulting primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) is a long RNA molecule with a hairpin structure. This pri-miRNA is processed by an enzyme complex called the microprocessor complex, which includes the enzyme Drosha and its co-factor DGCR8. The microprocessor complex cleaves the pri-miRNA, generating a shorter hairpin structure known as the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA).

The pre-miRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by the protein Exportin-5. Once in the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA undergoes further processing by an enzyme called Dicer. Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA, releasing a double-stranded RNA molecule. One strand of this duplex is the mature miRNA, while the other strand, known as the miRNA* or miRNA passenger strand, is typically degraded.

The mature miRNA strand is then loaded into a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC complex, which contains an Argonaute protein, binds to the mature miRNA and guides it to specific messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules that have complementary sequences to the miRNA. The miRNA acts as a guide, base-pairing with the target mRNA, usually in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). This interaction between the miRNA and the target mRNA can lead to post-transcriptional gene silencing through various mechanisms.

The binding of miRNA to the target mRNA can result in mRNA degradation, preventing its translation into a protein, or it can inhibit translation directly, reducing the efficiency of protein synthesis. By binding to specific mRNA molecules, miRNAs can regulate the expression of multiple genes, influencing various biological processes, including development, differentiation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis.

MiRNAs have been implicated in numerous diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular disorders, neurological disorders, and immune-related conditions. Their dysregulation can have significant impacts on gene expression networks and contribute to disease pathogenesis.

In summary, miRNAs are small RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by binding to target mRNAs and modulating their stability and translation efficiency.

## Synthesis

miRNAs are produced from longer RNA precursors called pri-miRNAs. Pri-miRNAs are first transcribed by RNA polymerase II and then processed by a complex of proteins called the Drosha/DGCR8 complex. The Drosha/DGCR8 complex cleaves pri-miRNAs to produce pre-miRNAs. Pre-miRNAs are then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where they are further processed by a second complex of proteins called the Dicer/TRBP complex. The Dicer/TRBP complex cleaves pre-miRNAs to produce mature miRNAs.

Mature miRNAs are then incorporated into a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC then binds to complementary sequences of mRNA, leading to either the degradation of the mRNA or the inhibition of its translation.

## Synthesis in vitro

MicroRNA (miRNA) can be synthesized in vitro using various methods. Here's a general overview of one common approach:

1. Designing miRNA sequence: First, the target miRNA sequence is designed based on the specific miRNA molecule of interest. The sequence is typically chosen from the known miRNA database or based on the desired function.

2. DNA synthesis: Once the miRNA sequence is designed, it needs to be synthesized as a DNA molecule. Several methods are available for DNA synthesis, including solid-phase synthesis or enzymatic synthesis using DNA polymerases. The synthesized DNA is often referred to as the "miRNA precursor" or "pre-miRNA" since it serves as a template for generating the mature miRNA molecule.

3. Insertion into a vector: The synthesized DNA sequence is then inserted into a suitable vector, such as a plasmid or a viral vector. The vector provides the necessary elements for the subsequent steps, such as a promoter for transcription and a polyadenylation signal for stabilization.

4. Transcription: The vector containing the miRNA precursor sequence is introduced into a suitable host cell, such as bacteria or mammalian cells. Once inside the host cell, the promoter present in the vector drives the transcription of the miRNA precursor into a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) molecule.

5. Pri-miRNA processing: The pri-miRNA undergoes processing steps to convert it into a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA). This processing involves the activity of the Drosha enzyme, which cleaves the pri-miRNA at specific sites to generate a hairpin structure.

6. Export to cytoplasm: The pre-miRNA molecule is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by a protein called Exportin-5. Exportin-5 recognizes and binds to the hairpin structure of the pre-miRNA, facilitating its transport.

7. Dicer cleavage: In the cytoplasm, the pre-miRNA is further processed by an enzyme called Dicer. Dicer recognizes the hairpin structure and cleaves it, releasing a double-stranded RNA molecule.

8. RISC loading: One strand of the double-stranded RNA, known as the mature miRNA strand, is preferentially selected and loaded into a protein complex called RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The RISC complex helps in guiding the mature miRNA to its target mRNA molecules.

9. mRNA regulation: The mature miRNA, associated with the RISC complex, binds to complementary sequences on the target mRNA molecules. This binding can lead to mRNA degradation or translational repression, thereby regulating the expression of the target genes.

It's important to note that the specific methods and techniques used for miRNA synthesis may vary depending on the desired application and research protocols.
