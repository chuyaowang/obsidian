# Complex Diseases

**Complex diseases**, also called **multifactorial diseases**, do not follow simple inheritance patterns like [Mendelian Diseases](Mendelian%20Diseases.md). They arise from a combination of **multiple genetic factors** and **environmental influences**.

## Key Characteristics:

- **Polygenic**: Multiple genes (often tens, hundreds, or even thousands) contribute to the risk of developing the disease. Each genetic variant may have a small effect individually, but together they can increase disease susceptibility.
- **Environmental factors**: In addition to genetics, factors like lifestyle, diet, stress, and exposure to toxins play a major role in disease development.
- **No clear inheritance pattern**: Complex diseases do not follow clear inheritance patterns like autosomal dominant or recessive traits. They run in families, but the risk is less predictable and is influenced by many variables.
- **Incomplete penetrance**: Not everyone with a genetic predisposition will develop the disease. The genetic risk factors increase susceptibility but do not guarantee disease development.
- **Later onset**: Complex diseases often develop later in life, as a result of the cumulative interaction of genes and environmental factors over time.

## Examples:

- **Heart Disease**: Involves numerous genes related to cholesterol metabolism, inflammation, and blood pressure, combined with factors like diet, smoking, and exercise.
- **Type 2 Diabetes**: A result of genetic susceptibility combined with lifestyle factors like obesity and physical inactivity.
- **Alzheimer’s Disease**: Has genetic components (e.g., the **APOE** gene) but is also influenced by age, lifestyle, and environmental factors.
- **Hypertension**: A multifactorial condition with contributions from various genes and lifestyle choices such as diet and salt intake.
- **Asthma**: Influenced by genetic factors related to immune response, as well as environmental triggers like allergens and pollution.

## Inheritance and Risk:

- Complex diseases do **run in families**, but the exact pattern is difficult to predict. 
- Family history can increase risk, but it is not deterministic, meaning having a genetic predisposition doesn’t guarantee you will get the disease.
- **Gene-environment interaction**: Even with a genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices (e.g., diet, exercise, avoiding smoking) can significantly affect disease outcomes.
- **Complex diseases** are harder to predict and prevent due to their polygenic nature and the influence of external factors, which makes them the focus of extensive genetic research and [GWAS](GWAS.md) to uncover the risk factors involved.
