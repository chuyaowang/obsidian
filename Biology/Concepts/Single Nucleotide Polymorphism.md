# SNP

SNP is short for single nucleotide polymorphism, and it is a single base substitution but limited to **germline** DNA. For a SNP to occur, a large fraction of the population should have a [Single Nucleotide Variant](Single%20Nucleotide%20Variant.md) — usually this has to be around 1%.

SNPs can be either in a non-coding region or in a coding region. A SNP in a coding region can be either synonymous or non-synonymous, and those that are non-synonymous can be categorized either as missense or nonsense.
