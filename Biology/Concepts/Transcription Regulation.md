# Transcription Regulation Mechanisms

> Most common ones

- [Promoter](Promoter.md): Is a genomic region, where the transcription machinery can bind to transcribe the following gene into an [RNA molecule](mRNA.md). Often, promoter regions can be associated with a high CG content.
- Terminator: Is a genomic region, where the transcription process, and thus the gene transcript, ends.
- Silencer: A genomic pattern that decreases the frequency of transcription and thus the expression of the regulated gene.
- [Enhancer](Enhancer.md): A genomic pattern that increases the frequency of transcription and thus the expression of the regulated gene. Silencer as well as enhancer DNA can be far from the gene in a linear way; however, it is spatially close to the promoter and gene. This is managed by folding of the DNA.
- CpG islands: Genomic regions, which are enriched by Cs followed by a G (CpG, p stands for the phosphate in the DNA backbone). Cytosines in CpG islands can be methylated, which is an epigenetic regulatory mechanism of gene expression. In most cases DNA methylation is associated to the inactivation of the corresponding genes.
- Epigenetics: Includes CpG island DNA methylation as mentioned above, but also histone modiﬁcations inﬂuencing transcriptional activity.
- UTRs (untranslated regions): The 5’UTR is located before the start codon and the 3’-UTR is the region between the stop codon and the poly-A-tail of the mRNA.
