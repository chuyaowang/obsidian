## Transcription Initiation

### Prokaryotes

In bacterial promoters, the **-35 to -10 sequence** refers to two conserved regions upstream of the transcription start site that play a crucial role in the initiation of transcription.

1. **-35 Sequence**: This region is located approximately 35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site and typically has a consensus sequence of **TTGACA**. It functions as a binding site for the **σ (sigma) factor**, a component of RNA polymerase. The sigma factor helps the RNA polymerase recognize and bind to the promoter. The strength of this binding can influence the efficiency of transcription initiation.

2. **-10 Sequence** (also called the Pribnow box): This is located about 10 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site, with a consensus sequence of **TATAAT**. It helps in **melting the DNA duplex**, meaning it allows the two strands of DNA to separate, which is essential for RNA polymerase to access the template strand and begin transcription.

Together, the **-35 and -10 sequences** ensure that RNA polymerase properly binds and initiates transcription at the correct site.

### Eukaryotes

The **TATA box** is a DNA sequence found in the core promoter region of many eukaryotic genes. It serves as a crucial element in the transcription initiation process. Here's what it does:

1. **Binding Site for Transcription Factors**: The TATA box is typically located about 25–35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Its consensus sequence is **TATAAA**. It provides a recognition and binding site for the **TATA-binding protein (TBP)**, a component of the **transcription factor IID (TFIID)** complex. Once TBP binds to the TATA box, it helps recruit other transcription factors and **RNA polymerase II** to form the transcription pre-initiation complex.

2. **Facilitates DNA Unwinding**: The TATA box is rich in adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases, which have weaker hydrogen bonds compared to guanine (G) and cytosine (C). This makes the TATA box region easier to unwind, facilitating the separation of the DNA strands. This unwinding is necessary for RNA polymerase II to access the template strand and initiate transcription.

3. **Positioning of Transcription Start Site**: The presence of the TATA box helps to define the exact location where transcription will begin, as it positions the RNA polymerase II complex in the right place relative to the transcription start site.

While the TATA box is common in many eukaryotic genes, not all genes contain it. In genes lacking a TATA box, other regulatory sequences fulfill similar roles in transcription initiation.
## Sigma factors

- A component of RNA polymerase.
- Bindings to the [Promoter](Promoter.md)

## RNA Polymerase

- RNA Polymerase I: most rRNA genes
- RNA Polymerase II: protein coding genes, miRNA genes, genes for small small RNAs
- RNA Polymerase III: tRNA genes, rRNA gene, genes for many other small RNA

> [!note] Genes on forward and reverse strands
> There is a difference between the **forward / reverse** (also top / bottom) strand of DNA, and the **template / coding** strand during transcription. The designation of forward / reverse is rather arbitrary, one of the strands has to be forward (left (5') to right (3')), the other reverse, but it makes no practical difference which goes into which direction. DNA is double stranded and both strands go from 5' -> 3' in opposite directions. The template and coding strand during transcription are a specific feature of transcribed DNA sequences, and typically relate to features of the 5' -> 3' sequence of the DNA, such as promoters and coding sequences.

> For example this short double stranded DNA sequence:
> 
> ```
>  5' ATTTACGTATGTACAT 3' 
>  3' TAAATGCATACATGTA 5'
> ```
> 
> There is an ATG start codon in 5' -> 3' direction on the bottom strand, and this could serve as the start codon of a coding strand after RNA transcription of a protein coding sequence. In this case, the **template strand** would be the top strand, the **bottom strand** is the coding strand. Transcription would happen on the top strand from right to left, so in **reverse** (-).

> [!note] Coding and template strand
> The coding strand, or sense strand, is the 5' to 3' strand during transcription. The template strand, or antisense strand, is the 3' to 5' strand during transcription.
