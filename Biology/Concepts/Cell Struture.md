# Cell Structure

- Peroxisome: oxidative reactions to break down long fatty acids, amino acid chains, and reduces reactive oxygen species. Originate from the ER.
- Lysosome: recycle other organelles during autophagy, digest macromolecules
- Microtubule: support cell structure, cell division, connected to the centrosome
- Actin: beneath the cell membrane, cell support, movement, engulfment, division
- Centrosome with pair of centrioles
- Chromatin
- Nuclear pore
- Nuclear envelop
- Ribosome: translation, small dots in a cell figure
- Golgi apparatus: process and package proteins and lipids, especially those proteins that will be exported to other cells.
- Intermediate filaments
- Plasma membrane
- Nucleolus
- Nucleus
- Endoplasmic reticulum: protein synthesis and folding, lipid biogenesis, calcium metabolism
- Mitochondrion
