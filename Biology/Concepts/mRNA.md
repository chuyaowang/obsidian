# mRNA

## Transcription

### Sense and antisense strand

The sense strand is the top strand. It has the same sequence as the mRNA except T is exchanged for U in mRNA. The antisense strand is the complement to the sense strand and the template for transcription.

Regulators that bind to the antisense strand can stop transcription from happening, acting as a gene regulatory mechanism.

## Introns and exons

The introns do not code for proteins, only the exons do. The introns must be removed in mRNA processing.

Alternative splicing is a mechanism that combines different exons in the same gene to produce different proteins. 

The nucleotide sequences GU and AG are splicing signals, but having those signals does not indicate mandatory splicing. Splicing only takes place at the intersection between introns and exons.

## Small nuclear RNA

Small nuclear RNA (snRNA) is essential for mRNA splicing.

## Small interfering RNA

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) mediates degradation of distinct mRNAs and closing of gene loci leading to decreased gene expression.

## [Micro RNA](microRNA.md)

Micro RNA (miRNA) blocks the translation of mRNAs.
