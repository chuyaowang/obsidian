# Cell Membrane

## Structure

Cholesterol, Phospholipids, glycolipids

Cholesterol lowers fluidity

New memberane material synthesized in the ER

## Oxygen transport

Oxygen can dissolve in the lipid bilayer and travel through the membrane freely.
## Enzymes

Transporters


proteins can reversibly associate with membranes by means of amphipathic helix
