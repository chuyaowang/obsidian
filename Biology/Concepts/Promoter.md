# Promoter

## Definition

A promoter is a region of DNA that controls the initiation of transcription of a gene. It is located upstream of the gene, on the same strand of DNA. Promoters are typically about 100-1000 base pairs long, and they contain specific sequences that **bind** to [transcription factors](Transcription%20Factor.md). Transcription factors are proteins that [regulate](Transcription%20Regulation.md) gene expression. When transcription factors bind to the promoter, they help to recruit RNA polymerase, the enzyme that transcribes DNA into RNA.

The promoter is a critical part of the gene regulatory network. It determines when and how a gene is expressed. Promoters can be regulated by a variety of factors, including the cell type, the developmental stage, and the environment.

Here are some of the important functions of a promoter:

-   It determines the start point of transcription.
-   It recruits RNA polymerase to the gene.
-   It helps to regulate the level of gene expression.
-   It can be modified by transcription factors to control gene expression.

The promoter is a complex and important region of DNA. It plays a critical role in the regulation of gene expression.

## Components

-   **Core promoter:** The core promoter is the essential part of the promoter that is required for transcription initiation. It is located about 10-35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site (TSS). The core promoter contains two short DNA sequences, the -10 element and the -35 element. The -10 element is also known as the Pribnow box and has the consensus sequence TATAAT. The -35 element has the consensus sequence TTGACA.
-   **Upstream regulatory elements:** Upstream regulatory elements are located further upstream of the core promoter. They can bind to transcription factors that regulate the level of gene expression. Some common upstream regulatory elements include the TATA box, the initiator element, and the CpG island.
-   **Distal regulatory elements:** Distal regulatory elements are located far upstream of the gene. They can bind to transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes in response to environmental cues. Some common distal regulatory elements include [Enhancer](Enhancer.md) and silencers.
