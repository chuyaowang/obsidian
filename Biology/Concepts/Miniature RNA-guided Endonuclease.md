# miniature RNA-guided endonuclease

## Overview

A miniature RNA-guided endonuclease refers to a small RNA-guided enzyme that can cleave DNA or RNA molecules at specific target sequences. These endonucleases are often derived from naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas systems or other RNA-guided nucleases. They are called "miniature" because they are smaller in size compared to the well-known CRISPR-associated Cas9 endonuclease.

## Mechanism of action

The concept of miniature RNA-guided endonucleases is based on the ability of RNA molecules to guide the nuclease to a specific target sequence through complementary base pairing. The RNA molecule acts as a guide or "guide RNA" (gRNA), providing the specificity for recognizing and binding to the target DNA or RNA sequence. Once the guide RNA binds to the target sequence, the endonuclease domain of the enzyme cleaves the DNA or RNA, leading to targeted disruption or modification of the genetic material.

## Examples

Several types of miniature RNA-guided endonucleases have been developed or discovered, including:

1.  CRISPR-Cpf1: Cpf1 (also known as Cas12a) is a smaller endonuclease compared to Cas9 and is derived from the CRISPR-Cas system. It utilizes a single RNA molecule as a guide (crRNA) to recognize and cleave target DNA sequences.
    
2.  CRISPR-C2c2: C2c2 (also known as Cas13) is an RNA-guided endonuclease derived from CRISPR-Cas systems found in bacteria. Unlike Cas9 and Cpf1, which target DNA, C2c2 specifically targets and cleaves RNA molecules.
    
3.  RNA-guided RNA endonucleases: There are also naturally occurring or engineered RNA-guided endonucleases that specifically target RNA molecules. These enzymes can cleave specific RNA sequences, leading to RNA degradation or modification.
    

Miniature RNA-guided endonucleases have gained significant attention in the field of genetic engineering and genome editing due to their programmable nature and ease of use. They offer potential applications in various areas, including gene editing, gene regulation, diagnostics, and therapeutics.
