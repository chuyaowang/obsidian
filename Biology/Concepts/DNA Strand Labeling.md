# DNA Strand Labeling

## Different labelings

Given a sequence TGCCA, it can be considered as:

- as 5' - TGCCA - 3'
- as a reverse of 5' - ACCGT - 3'
- as a complement to 5' - ACGGT - 3'
- as a reverse complement to 5' - TGGCA - 3'

## Definitions

The upper strand goes from 5' to 3'. The lower strand goes from 3' to 5'.
- The reverse strand is the upper strand read from 3' to 5'.
- The complement strand is the complement to the upper strand read from 3' to 5'.
- The reverse complement is the complement to the upper strand read from 5' to 3', which is in the reverse direction.

## Example

Original sequence: `ACGTATAGGCTGACACGTAGAGATGGATGACCATAG`  
Reverse sequence: `GATACCAGTAGGTAGAGATGCACAGTCGGATATGCA`  
Complement sequence: `TGCATATCCGACTGTGCATCTCTACCTACTGGTATC`  
Reverse complement: `CTATGGTCATCCATCTCTACGTGTCAGCCTATACGT`
