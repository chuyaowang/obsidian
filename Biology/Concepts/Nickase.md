# Nickase

## Overview

A nickase is an enzyme that cuts one strand of a double-stranded DNA molecule at a specific site. Nickases are used in a variety of applications, including genetic engineering, DNA sequencing, and DNA repair.

There are many different types of nickases, but they all work in the same basic way. The nickase binds to the DNA at a specific site, and then uses its catalytic activity to cut one strand of the DNA molecule. This creates a single-stranded nick in the DNA.

Nickases can be used to make specific changes to DNA. For example, they can be used to insert new DNA sequences into a gene, or to delete existing DNA sequences. Nickases can also be used to repair damaged DNA.

## Examples

-   **Cas9 nickases** are created by mutating one of the two nuclease domains of the Cas9 protein. This mutation prevents the Cas9 protein from cleaving both strands of DNA, but it still allows the protein to bind to specific DNA sequences. Cas9 nickases are often used in combination with a second nickase, which cleaves the opposite strand of DNA. This creates a double-strand break, which can then be repaired by the cell's natural DNA repair mechanisms.
-   **Zinc finger nickases** are created by fusing a zinc finger protein to a nickase enzyme. Zinc finger proteins can bind to specific DNA sequences, and when they are fused to a nickase enzyme, this allows the nickase to be targeted to specific DNA sequences. Zinc finger nickases are often used in genetic engineering applications, such as the development of new drugs.
-   **Restriction enzyme nickases** are created by fusing a restriction enzyme to a nickase enzyme. Restriction enzymes are enzymes that can cleave DNA at specific sequences. When they are fused to a nickase enzyme, this allows the nickase to be targeted to specific DNA sequences. Restriction enzyme nickases are often used in DNA sequencing applications.
