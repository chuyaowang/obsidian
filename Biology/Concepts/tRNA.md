# tRNA

## Definition

tRNA is a type of RNA molecule that acts as an adapter between the information encoded in the genetic code (mRNA) and the amino acids that make up proteins. It plays a vital role in the translation process by carrying specific amino acids to the ribosome, the cellular machinery responsible for protein synthesis.

## Structure

Each tRNA molecule has a unique structure consisting of three important regions. The first region is called the anticodon, which is a sequence of three nucleotides that is complementary to a specific codon on the mRNA. The codon-anticodon pairing ensures that the correct amino acid is added to the growing protein chain during translation.

The second region of tRNA is the acceptor stem, which is a sequence of nucleotides that binds to the corresponding amino acid. Enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases attach the appropriate amino acid to the tRNA molecule, creating an aminoacyl-tRNA complex. Each amino acid has its specific aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase, which ensures accurate pairing between the amino acid and its corresponding tRNA.

The third region of tRNA is known as the TΨC arm (or T-arm), which contains a modified nucleotide called pseudouridine (Ψ). This arm plays a role in stabilizing the interaction between tRNA and the ribosome during protein synthesis.

## Function

During translation, tRNA molecules transport amino acids to the ribosome in a specific order dictated by the mRNA sequence. The ribosome reads the mRNA codons and, with the help of tRNA molecules, ensures that the correct amino acid is added to the growing protein chain. This process continues until a stop codon is reached, resulting in the termination of protein synthesis.

In summary, tRNA molecules play a critical role in protein synthesis by carrying specific amino acids to the ribosome based on the mRNA codons. Their unique structure, including the anticodon, acceptor stem, and TΨC arm, allows for accurate recognition and pairing of amino acids with the genetic code. This process ensures the faithful translation of genetic information into functional proteins, which are essential for the proper functioning of cells.
