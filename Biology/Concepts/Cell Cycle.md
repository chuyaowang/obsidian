# Cell Cycle

## Phases

The cell cycle consists of four main phases:

1. **G1 Phase (Gap 1 phase)**: This is the first growth phase where the cell grows and carries out its normal functions. It prepares for DNA replication.

2. **S Phase (Synthesis phase)**: During this phase, DNA synthesis or replication occurs. The cell duplicates its genetic material to prepare for division.

3. **G2 Phase (Gap 2 phase)**: In this phase, the cell continues to grow and prepares for **mitosis** (cell division). It also synthesizes proteins and organelles needed for division.

4. **M Phase (Mitotic phase)**: This is the phase where actual cell division occurs. It includes two main processes:
   - **Mitosis**: The division of the cell nucleus into two identical nuclei, each with a full set of chromosomes.
   - **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm and other organelles to form two separate daughter cells.

These phases ensure that the cell grows, replicates its DNA accurately, and divides properly into two daughter cells.
