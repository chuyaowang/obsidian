# Cell Cycle

## Phases

The cell cycle consists of four main phases:

1. **G1 Phase (Gap 1 phase)**: This is the first growth phase where the cell grows and carries out its normal functions. It prepares for DNA replication.

2. **S Phase (Synthesis phase)**: During this phase, DNA synthesis or replication occurs. The cell duplicates its genetic material to prepare for division.

3. **G2 Phase (Gap 2 phase)**: In this phase, the cell continues to grow and prepares for **mitosis** (cell division). It also synthesizes proteins and organelles needed for division.

4. **M Phase (Mitotic phase)**: This is the phase where actual cell division occurs. It includes two main processes:
   - **Mitosis**: The division of the cell nucleus into two identical nuclei, each with a full set of chromosomes.
   - **Cytokinesis**: The division of the cytoplasm and other organelles to form two separate daughter cells.

These phases ensure that the cell grows, replicates its DNA accurately, and divides properly into two daughter cells.

## Activities

The steps you mentioned—DNA helicase deposition, ORC phosphorylation, helicase activation, and licensing of replication origins—are all integral to the regulation of DNA replication during the **cell cycle**. Here's where each of these processes occurs and their significance:

1. **DNA Helicase Deposition on DNA at the Replication Origins (G1 Phase)**:
   - **When**: This occurs during the late **G1 phase**.
   - **Significance**: The DNA helicase (specifically MCM2-7 complex) is loaded onto the replication origins to form the pre-replication complex (pre-RC). This step is crucial as it "licenses" the origin, preparing it for replication. Helicase deposition is tightly regulated to ensure replication occurs only once per cell cycle.

2. **ORC Phosphorylation (G1 to S Phase Transition)**:
   - **When**: The **origin recognition complex (ORC)** is phosphorylated as cells transition from **G1 to S phase**.
   - **Significance**: ORC phosphorylation, mainly by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), inhibits the reassembly of the pre-RC on origins that have already initiated replication, ensuring that replication occurs only once per cycle and preventing re-replication.

3. **DNA Helicase Activation (S Phase)**:
   - **When**: DNA helicase activation occurs in the **S phase**, after the helicase is deposited in the G1 phase.
   - **Significance**: The activation of the helicase, primarily through phosphorylation by DDK (Dbf4-dependent kinase) and CDKs, allows it to unwind the DNA at the origin, initiating the replication process. Helicase activation marks the commitment to DNA synthesis.

4. **Licensing of Replication Origins (Late M to Early G1 Phase)**:
   - **When**: Licensing occurs in **late M phase to early G1 phase** of the cell cycle.
   - **Significance**: During licensing, replication origins are "marked" by the binding of key proteins like the ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1, which together load the MCM helicase onto the DNA. This step is essential for ensuring that each origin is used only once per cell cycle for replication. Once S phase begins, origins are "fired" and cannot be reused until the next cycle.

### Conclusion:
- **Helicase deposition** happens in G1 to prepare for replication.
- **ORC phosphorylation** prevents re-replication as cells enter S phase.
- **Helicase activation** occurs in S phase to initiate DNA unwinding.
- **Licensing** ensures origins are ready for replication but used only once per cell cycle.

These processes are tightly regulated to maintain genomic integrity during cell division.
