[0. VU Structural Bioinformatics](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/0.%20VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics.md)

## Why 3d structure

- To understand and manipulate protein function

## Sources of atomistic molecular structures

- Ab-initio folding
	- physics knowledge but expensive computation and wildly varing accuracy
- homology modeling and molecular dynamics
	- force-fields and starting models (experimental)
	- computationally very expensive
	- wildly varying accuracy
- AI methods
	- evolutionary data + structural knowledge from experimental models
	- fast and cheap (AlphaFold, RoseTTAFold)
	- Very accurate at the domain level (known to some extent)
	- But less so in domain organization or complexes
- NMR
	- uses _indirectly_ measured inter-atomic distances and torsion angles to fold a protein
	- can capture protein _dynamics_
	- not suitable for large proteins (> 200 AAs)
	- not very accurate (known)
- Cyrstallagraphy
	- Workhorse
	- Uses _indirectly_ measured (electron density) volume map to fit atomic model
	- suitable for most sizes of proteins and complexes
	- accurate to extremely accurate (known)
- Electro microscopy
	- Uses _indirectly_ measured (electron potential) volume map to fit atomic model
	- Especially suitable for _large and very large_ proteins and complexes
	- wide range of accuracy (known)

### Comparison in numbers

Here is the completed table for the three structure determination methods:

| Method                | Resolution                                           | Size Range        | Experimental Output |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------- |
| X-ray Crystallography | 0.5-3.5 Å                                            | 50-1000 residues  | Diffraction pattern |
| Cryo-EM               | 2-5 Å (sometimes >6 Å for low-resolution structures) | 200-2000 residues | Density map         |
| NMR Spectroscopy      | >6 Å (lower resolution compared to X-ray and EM)     | 50-250 residues   | Chemical shifts     |

#### Explanation

- **Resolution:** X-ray crystallography provides the highest resolution (often below 2 Å for well-ordered crystals). Cryo-EM has improved in resolution but still generally ranges from 2-5 Å, though some lower-resolution maps can exceed 6 Å. NMR, due to its reliance on solution-state measurements and molecular motion, typically has lower resolution (>6 Å).
- **Size Range:** X-ray crystallography is best suited for small to medium-sized proteins (50-1000 residues), as large complexes may be difficult to crystallize. Cryo-EM excels for large macromolecular complexes (200-2000 residues or even larger), while NMR is limited to small proteins (50-250 residues) due to signal complexity and spectral overlap.
- **Experimental Output:** X-ray crystallography produces diffraction patterns from which electron density maps are derived. Cryo-EM directly produces density maps. NMR measures chemical shifts, which provide information on the local environment of atoms.

## X-ray crystallagraphy workflow

- purified protein
- protein crystal
- experimental data
- map
- 3d structure model
- all steps influence the final model

### Protein production

- Cloning, over-expression, purification
	- Tolerance for high concentrations
	- Proteins may be poly-histidine tagged for purification
		- May end up in the final structure
- Crystal production additional requirements
	- long-term protein stability
	- not too much flexibility: need to modify if so
	- no heterogeneity in terms biological states
		- cannot mix active and inactive

### Custom proteins for crystallography

- construct design
	- use trimmed versions of the protein that are sutiable for crystallization
	- you may not be looking at the complete protein
		- check the sequence of the model
- mutation
	- more stable
	- inactive
	- remove glycosylation: can be quite big
	- watch out for accidental mutants
		- will not show up in the sequence

### Crystallization is not straightforward

- Try many conditions with robots
	- protein
		- concentration
		- buffer (type and pH)
		- stabilizers (reducing agents like TCEP)
		- ligands
	- temperature
	- Precipitants
		- salts: NaCl, NH42SO4
		- water binding compounds: poly-ethyleneglycol, MPD, ethanol
	- additives may end up in your structure model

### Protein crystals

- Protein crystals are regular arrays of protein molecules
	- 20-80 solvent
	- few crystal contacts, but some effect on structure
- Some residues can move
	- Disorder: invisible loops/side chains
	- multiple alternate conformations
- Protein crystals contain active protein
	- Enzyme turnover
	- Add ligands after crystallization (soaking)
		- can be automated for drug lead discovery

### X-ray data collection

- Crystal diffracts X-rays onto detector
- Crystal is rotated to get all possible diffraction data

### X-ray data processing

- Detector shaped as a disk; beam shots to the center and reflect to the side; further higher resolution
- Spots on diffraction images are mapped to crystal space (indexing)
- Relative amplitude is measured (integration)

### Structure solution

- fit atoms in the electron density
	- Fourier transform
- measured amplitudes in diffraction are related to electron density in the crystal
	- Formula
	- $\alpha$: phase
- we cannot just add up x-ray waves at any position in the cell
- there is relative phase between them
- but the phase is not measured

### Solution of the phase problem

- trick: get the phases from atomic model (inverse Fourier)
	- Many reasonably placed atoms give good phase estimate
- molecular replacement with search model (homolog or an AI model)
	- 6 dimensional search to place and orient search model in the crystal cell
	- can be split into a rotation + a translation search
- a good solution gives you a map with clear room for improvement

### Map interpretation and model building

- Find structural elements: a-helices, b-strands
- Fit amino acid sequence

### High-throughput compound screening

- For drug development, if you can make many good crystals, you can test a library of compounds by automated crystal soaking
	- ligands: stronger binding, smaller chemical space, better with a lead
	- fragments: weaker binding, huge chemical space, better without a lead

## Experimental background cryo-electron microscopy

### Sample preparation

- Need good protein separation on the grid in very thin 'ice'
	- less purification
	- might use cross-links
	- different concentrations
	- buffer conditions
	- different types of grids
	- a lot of trial and error
	- some automation
- grid placed under electron microscope
	- images taken (a video)
	- different orientations of the protein
	- lots of data

### Processing pipeline: from 2D

- Pick particles from images
- Classification of particles

### to 3D

- heterogeneous refinement
- helical refinement
- density map
- refined density map
- atomic model in electron density

## Map quality comparison

### X-ray map quality

- electron density
- one overall resolution
	- resolution defines model precision
- quality depends on model (phases)
- maps improve during model building
	- improved phases

### EM

- Electron potential (local charges matter)
- Image reconstruction gives _local_ resolution
- Resolution still a matter of debate
- No phase error, maps do not improve
- Quality depends a lot on data selection and processing

### Difference map for x-ray

- show how the model should be changed
	- not commonly used in cryo-EM (difficult to make)

### Improving your structure model

- Diffraction are not complete
- Atoms in the structures are a description of the different amplitude and the unknown phase
	- atoms co

### Refinement without maps


## Model validation

- Test whether the model fits the x-ray data
- **R-factor**: fit to the x-ray data
- Is the model not overfitted (fit to the noise)
- These can only be answered by inspecting data not used in the refinement
	- R-free
	- holdout some of the x-rya data
- R-factor and R-free should be close
	- if not add weight on the prior knowledge of protein structure

## Using structure models

### PDB

- contains 2000k entries
- freely accessible
- an archive
	- some entries are very old (1974)
	- all entries are models of an experiment
	- experiments and models have errors
		- sometimes very grave errors
		- not all crystallographers are awesome
		- cryo-em has more enthusiasm than scientific rigor
- Check before use

### check models

- is the model precise enough for my research
	- depends a lot on the limitations of the method
	- what are the error margins
	- does the model represent the biological state of interest
- validity: is the model accurate enough for my use
	- depends on the maker of the model
	- does the model fit the experimental data
	- fir our prior structural knowledge
- check both

### structure validation

 - must obey the obvious structural features of protein structures
	 - well defined secondary structure elements
	 - hydrophilic residues outside, hydrophobic insdie
		 - except for membrane proteins
	 - folded proteins make excellent H-bonds
		 - otherwise the unfolded would be more stable than folded
	 - Steric hindrance cause typical torsion angles

### check all relevant information

### Validation on a PDB entry

- Present for every entry
- Compares the entry to all other structures and structures of similar resolution in the PDB

### Backbone torsion angles


### Validation of backbone torsion angles

- Ramachandran plot
	- defined relation of phi and psi angles in proteins
	- compare to all known structre models
	- many outliers detected could indicate problem
	- may be the strongest validation tool available
		- can be cheated

### Backbone torsion angles in maps

= {eptodes are f;at

### which parts of the models arereliable

- Use the maps

### identify model errors

- Use the maps
- Poorly fitted side-chains
- Bad peptide conformations

### Find missing things

- Use the maps
- Missing water molecule
- Missing alternate conformation

### Find undiscovered artefacts

- Use the maps
- Accidental mutant Lys -> Arg and missing sulfate

### Validation of ligands

- Validation steps:
	- Is something there?
		- check the (difference) density
	- is it the expected ligand
		- check contacts
		- keep crystallization conditions in mind
		- check the difference density in detail
	- Is the geometry

### The crystal affects the structure

- How was the crystal made
	- crystallization agents may bind unexpectedly
	- crystal packing may influence structure
