> [!info]- How DSSP works
> DSSP (Define Secondary Structure of Proteins) determines **hydrogen bonding information** from a protein structure using a **geometric and electrostatic approach** based on backbone atomic coordinates. The key steps in how DSSP assigns hydrogen bonds are:
> 
> ### 1. Identifying Backbone Donors and Acceptors
> 
> DSSP focuses on **main-chain (backbone) hydrogen bonding**, which is crucial for secondary structure formation. The relevant atoms are:
> 
> - **Donors:** Amide nitrogen (**N**) and its attached hydrogen (**H**) in the peptide bond.
> - **Acceptors:** Carbonyl oxygen (**O**) of the peptide bond.
> 
> ### 2. Calculating Hydrogen Bond Energies (Electrostatic Model)
> 
> DSSP estimates hydrogen bond strength using an **electrostatic energy function** based on the **dipole interactions** of peptide bonds. The hydrogen bond energy $E$ is calculated using:
> 
> $E = q_1 q_2 \left( \frac{1}{r_{\text{ON}}} + \frac{1}{r_{\text{CH}}} - \frac{1}{r_{\text{OH}}} - \frac{1}{r_{\text{CN}}} \right) \times 332 \text{ kcal/mol}$
> 
> where:
> 
> - $q_1$ and $q_2$ are partial charges on atoms.
> - $r_{\text{ON}}, r_{\text{CH}}, r_{\text{OH}}, r_{\text{CN}}$ are distances between relevant atoms.
> - The **cutoff for hydrogen bonding** is typically set at $E < -0.5$ kcal/mol, meaning only strong enough interactions are considered true hydrogen bonds.
> 
> ### 3. Assigning Secondary Structure
> 
> Based on the detected hydrogen bonds, DSSP classifies residues into different secondary structure types:
> 
> - **α-Helices (H)** → Formed when **four consecutive residues** engage in strong hydrogen bonds in a **(i, i+4) pattern**.
> - **β-Sheets (E)** → Formed when residues engage in **inter-strand hydrogen bonding** in **parallel or antiparallel β-sheets**.
> - **Turns and bends (T, S)** → Formed by **localized hydrogen bonding** or sharp angles in the backbone.
> - **Coil or loops (“ ” or “–”)** → Regions without regular hydrogen bonding.
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> 1. DSSP extracts **amide N-H donors** and **carbonyl O acceptors** from atomic coordinates.
> 2. It **computes hydrogen bond energies** using an **electrostatic dipole model**.
> 3. It **classifies secondary structures** based on **hydrogen bonding patterns**.
> 
> This method allows DSSP to **quantitatively** determine hydrogen bonding networks and assign secondary structures from raw PDB files.

## Differences between secondary structure types

- **Helix**: hydrophobic residues in buried side of helix, hydrophilic in exposed side
- **Sheet**:
	- Buried strand: hydrophobic
	- Edge strand ([rare](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/4.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction%20to%20Structure%20Prediction.md#Aggregated%20state)): alternating
		- R sticking inside of protein: hydrophobic
		- R sticking outside of protein: hydrophilic
		- ![5. VU SB Structure Feature Prediction 2025-02-17 10.02.21.excalidraw](5.%20VU%20SB%20Structure%20Feature%20Prediction%202025-02-17%2010.02.21.excalidraw.md)
- **Buried helix vs. buried strand**: both hydrophobic, but helix is longer. Strand that spans the entire protein is about 3 nm long. Helix is about 3.7 times longer.
- **Loop**: typically outside and hydrophilic

### Periodic sign in secondary structure


## Amino acids have preferences for secondary structure types

- Bulky residues with a C
- We can quantify these preferences by calculating the propensities

## Secondary structure prediction as a classification problem


### Double-loop cross validation



### What else can be included for prediction of secondary structure from sequence

- hydrophobicity pattern
- windowed approach
	- score every residue based on helix and sheet propensity
	- Look for series of $\ge$ 4 residues which for example have higher
	- --
- Sliding window approach 
- Markov models: 
	- TMHMM: prediction of transmembrane $\alpha$-helices
- Accuracy:
	- NetSurfP 2.0: 86%
	- AlphaFold: 84%
	- TMHMM: 97% helices, 77% topologies

## Neural network for prediction

### CNN

- Feature extractor
- Deeper layers extract more complex features
- Can be used for sequences
	- input: the amino acid sequence
	- The best performing methods typically use a homology based sequence profile as input rather than just the input sequence. Homology profile from [BLAST](3.%20MIT%20CompBio%20-%20Hashing,%20Database%20Search,%20BLAST%20algorithm.md#The%20BLAST%20Algorithm%20and%20Inexact%20Matching)
- NetSurfP-2.0 uses CNN and LSTM
	- predicts many things besides secondary structure
	- why predict many at the same time: more informative comparison between target and prediction -> better loss calculation -> better weights
- NetSurfP-3: 
	- similar for most features as 2.0, but much faster
	- useful for high-throughput analysis
- Part of AlphaFold2 as well

### 1. your biological question

- find the question to answer before training

### 2. describe and provide the dataset

- where does it come from
- provide it

### 3. remove sequence redundancy

- if not removed, there is homology between training and validation sets during cross-validation

### 4. specify input and output

- which features go in
- classification? per residue? per window? per sequence?

### 5. provide several evaluation metrics

- use many evaluation metrics for comparison to other methods

### 6. define positives and negatives

- clearly state how they are defined

### 7. clearly describe results with corresponding models and data

- make it clear in the figure caption

### 8. try to interpret the results

- use some methods to interpret the model
- drop features and see accuracy drops

### 9. do a fair comparison with other method

- use new test set for comparison

### 10. make your method available

- make it accessible
