## Protein protein interaction (PPI)

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250316201402.png)
- PPI simulation: simulate protein-protein interaction
- Question: how do they only interact with their targets and not other irrelavant proteins?
- Binding process: $A+B\leftrightharpoons AB$
- Reaction coordinate; center of masses distance
- Probability: proportional to free energy _difference_
- Sampling the lowly probable regions are slow in real time. Need techniques to sample these regions

## How to cross a barrier

- Pulling: add a force to pull the 2 proteins apart
	- problem: force depends on the speed the proteins are pulled apart. Pulling too fast results in an overestimation of interaction forces
- [Constraint force](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/appendix/Coarse-grained%20versus%20atomistic%20simulations.md#^0756de)
	- place the 2 proteins in different distances
	- **calculate** the force to keep the distance constant
	- at free energy minimum: almost no force required because it is stable
	- in higher energy regions, more force is required
- When does the method break down?
	- when the regions in between the discrete $r$ values (see [Coarse-grained versus atomistic simulations](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/appendix/Coarse-grained%20versus%20atomistic%20simulations.md) paper) are not approximately linear but contain peaks and valleys

## Another way: constraint potential

- More complex method: not a constraint force to keep the distance constant
- but constraint **potential**, called _umbrella potential_
- Constrains the sampling within a certain distance by adding the potential.
- The sampling distributes around the center, the further it gets, the less likely it gets
- Problem:
	- How to make sure the distribution is even since the states also have their natural free energy besides the added umbrella potential? ![[Media/11. VU SB Umbrella Sampling 2025-03-16 20.31.35.excalidraw]]
- Yield statistics within each umbrella
- Combine to obtain overall probabilities
	- Umbrella potential is a biasing potential
	- Need to remove the bias before combining
- Convert probabilities to energies

### X-coordinate and force during pulling

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250316205137.png)
- Position means distance in the plot
- In the beginning, distance does not change much, but force goes up
	- Moving **up** a free energy barrier
- Past the peak of force, distance increases linearly and force decreases
- Before starting umbrella sampling, need system _at different distances_. So even if fast pulling may distort the system and overestimate barrier heights, we can still use it to create reasonable structures at various distances.

### Distance and umbrella energy over time

- Simulate for 500 ps
- Distance and umbrella energy for an umbrella
- Energy is 0 at the mid-point of the umbrella; closer to the mid-point has lower energy
	- Plotting potential energy vs. distance: get the umbrella shape
- Energy can be calculated from the distance

### How many umbrellas

- between 20-50
- Need enough sampling _time_ to sample the whole umbrella
	- 5 ns
	- cover all distances
- Also depends on the free energy curve
	- some free energy landscape regions are easier to move around, reflecting easier transitioning between the protein states or moving the COMs of the proteins apart
- force constant: higher -> narrower umbrella, lower -> wider umbrella
	- narrower is more precise in controlling which area to sample
	- wider takes longer to run and samples from a wider area
	- for steep free energy curve better to use more narrow umbrellas than a few wide ones to ensure every place is sampled. With wider ones regions with higher free energy than other regions within the umbrella can get sampled less.
- overall, the key is to have enough overlap between umbrellas
	- let's say we have 2 umbrellas $A$ and $B$, they have an overlap region $AB$
	- If AB is less likely in B than in A, then it means B is centered around a region with higher free energy than A is. ![[Media/11. VU SB Umbrella Sampling 2025-03-17 00.47.48.excalidraw]]
	- A would sample the overlap more frequently than B does even with the biasing potential applied to both because the A is around a lower free energy point

### Umbrella histograms

- Histogram of different COM separation distances from different umbrellas
- Should have overlap
- Gaps would show in the final assembled PMF as 0 free energies
- Note that in valleys of the free energy profile, even if there is a gap (free energy 0), it may not get observed because the free energy is already very low. So always consult the histogram to find non-overlaps.

## Coarse grained sampling

- Groups amino acids into beads: apolar, intermediate, polar, charged
- Water is considered 4 atoms lumped into 1 sphere
- Close PMF to atomistic simulation (shown in [Coarse-grained versus atomistic simulations](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/appendix/Coarse-grained%20versus%20atomistic%20simulations.md) paper)
- Used constraint force, not umbrella simulation
- Energy (PMF) minimum (a negative value, not 0) is when the force is 0 (no force needed to keep the separation distance -> most stable -> energy minimum)
- Infinite distance: 0 force, 0 energy
- 500-600x faster
	- 4 times fewer particles, 16x fewer interactions
	- larger mass & softer potentials: larger particles move slower 
		- larger time step (2 fs -> 20 fs): 10x faster
		- shorter cutoffs  -> fewer interactions
- With CG, can run 10 ns simulation

## Correction of umbrella potential

- $$
p_{ij}=f_{i}c_{ij}p_{j}^\circ
$$, where $i$ is each umbrella, $j$ is bins in the umbrella's histogram, $p_{ij}$ is the observed probability of bin $j$ of umbrella $i$; $c_{ij}$ is the umbrella potential; $p_{j}$ is the unbiased probability in bin $j$; and $f_{i}$ is the weight of simulation $i$. This is the intrinsic probability of being in the distance range of that umbrella, or the baseline of the umbrella.
- $f_{i}$ is estimated iteratively
