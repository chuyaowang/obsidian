## Structure prediction

- Sequence to structure
- Different approaches from easy and reliable to complex and less reliable
- Which approach to use depends on the goal
	- predict where the functional site of the protein is
	- predict whether a specific substrate binds
	- predict if a certain residue may be exposed to the surface
	- requires different levels of **accuracy**
- Structure is more conserved than sequence
	- Two proteins with similar sequences are structurally similar
		- Key principle to many structure prediction algorithms
	- If a protein with a similar sequence has structure data, a good starting point for predicting structures can be found this way

## Structure prediction methods

### Two categories of difficulty

- Template-based modeling
	- Start from a structure from a similar protein, aka. **homology modeling**
- Template-free modeling
	- No starting point 🙁

### Homology modeling

- A close homolog is _essential_ for the methods to work properly
- Additional constraints: 
	- alignment between the model and the template sequence
	- template structure
- Small missing substructures, such as [Loops](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/1.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction.md#Loops) that are less conserved and hard to predict, may require a template-free modeling strategy.
- No close homologs:
	- Remote homology detection: [PSI-BLAST](2.%20VU%20FoB%20-%20Mutation,%20Evolution,%20and%20Sequence%20Alignment.md#PSI-BLAST)
	- Fold recognition
	- When these do not work, use template-free approach

> [!info]- Fold recognition
> ### Fold Recognition for Structure Prediction
> 
> **Fold recognition** (also known as **threading**) is a computational method used to predict the 3D structure of a protein by identifying similarities to known protein folds, even when there is **low or no sequence identity** to known structures. This method is particularly useful when homology modeling is not possible due to a lack of closely related sequences with solved structures.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Key Concept: The Protein Fold Database
> 
> - The **Protein Data Bank (PDB)** contains thousands of experimentally determined protein structures.
> - Although there are millions of protein sequences, the number of unique **folds** (overall 3D arrangements of secondary structure elements) is much smaller.
> - Fold recognition attempts to **match a query sequence to a known fold** in this structural database.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### How Fold Recognition Works
> 
> 1. **Input:** A protein sequence with unknown structure.
> 2. **Structural Database Search:**
>     - The sequence is "threaded" onto known 3D structures in a database.
>     - Different possible alignments are evaluated based on how well the sequence fits onto a given fold.
> 3. **Scoring Models:** The fit is scored using:
>     - **Statistical potentials:** Knowledge-based energy functions derived from known protein structures.
>     - **Physical energy models:** Including steric clashes, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic burial.
>     - **Sequence profiles:** Alignments of evolutionary-related proteins to identify conserved structural features.
> 4. **Best-Fitting Fold Selection:** The structure with the best compatibility is chosen as the predicted fold.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Strengths of Fold Recognition
> 
> - Can **predict structures even when sequence identity is very low** (<25%) compared to known proteins.
> - Helps **identify distant homologs** where sequence similarity is not obvious.
> - Useful for proteins without clear evolutionary relatives in databases.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Limitations
> 
> - **Lower accuracy than homology modeling** when a close homolog exists.
> - **Difficulties in modeling loops and side chains** since only the backbone fold is considered initially.
> - **Depends on the quality of available structure databases**—if no similar fold exists, prediction may fail.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Applications
> 
> - Functional annotation of newly sequenced proteins.
> - Identifying distant evolutionary relationships.
> - Aiding experimental structure determination by providing initial models.
> 
> Fold recognition serves as an intermediate method between **homology modeling** (when a clear template exists) and **de novo structure prediction** (when no known structures resemble the target).

### Template free approaches

- Coarse constraints from experiment or co-evolution analysis
- 'Ab initio' approach: from the scratch
	- knowledge-based energy terms are used to generate structural models based on sequence alone
	- small, suitable fragments from various PDB structures are then assembled to generate a large set of possible structural models. 
	- How to pick a model from this set and refine models further will be discussed in the next chapter.

> [!info]- Co-evolution for structure prediction
> ### How Co-evolution is Used for Protein Structure Prediction
> 
> **Co-evolution** refers to the idea that amino acid residues within a protein evolve in a correlated manner to maintain structural stability and function. This principle is leveraged in protein structure prediction to identify spatial **constraints** between residues, which can then be used to infer the 3D fold of the protein.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 1. The Basis of Co-evolution in Proteins
> 
> - Proteins need to maintain their structural integrity and function across evolutionary time.
> - If one residue in a protein mutates, another residue that interacts with it might also mutate to **compensate for the change** and preserve the interaction.
> - These **co-evolving** residue pairs can provide valuable information about which parts of the protein are in close physical proximity, even if their sequences are far apart in the linear chain.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) as Input
> 
> To detect co-evolution, a **multiple sequence alignment (MSA)** of homologous proteins is used:
> 
> - The MSA contains sequences of evolutionarily related proteins from different species.
> - By analyzing patterns of mutations across many sequences, _correlated changes_ (co-evolving pairs) can be identified.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. Detecting Co-evolution Using Statistical and Machine Learning Methods
> 
> Several computational approaches are used to extract co-evolutionary signals from MSAs:
> 
> 1. **Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA):**
>     
>     - A probabilistic model is applied to distinguish direct residue-residue contacts from indirect correlations.
>     - This helps separate **true physical interactions** from spurious correlations caused by shared ancestry.
> 2. **Mutual Information (MI):**
>     
>     - Measures how changes in one position are correlated with changes in another.
>     - However, MI can include indirect correlations and noise.
> 3. **Deep Learning Models (e.g., AlphaFold2):**
>     
>     - AlphaFold2 uses co-evolutionary patterns as features in a deep learning framework.
>     - It integrates MSAs with attention-based neural networks to learn complex dependencies between residues.
>     - This method captures both **local and long-range contacts**, greatly improving prediction accuracy.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. Mapping Co-evolution to 3D Structures
> 
> - Co-evolving residue pairs often correspond to spatially **close contacts** in the folded protein.
> - These **contact maps** serve as constraints for **predicting the 3D structure** using:
>     - **Energy-based modeling (e.g., Rosetta, Foldit)**
>     - **Deep learning-based predictors (e.g., AlphaFold2, RoseTTAFold)**
> 
> By enforcing predicted residue contacts, structure prediction methods can **correctly fold** the protein chain into a native-like structure, even when no close homologous structures are known.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **5. Importance and Applications**
> 
> - **Improved Accuracy:** Helps predict protein structures without requiring homologous templates.
> - **Function Prediction:** Identifies key residue interactions that define enzymatic activity or ligand binding sites.
> - **Protein-Protein Interactions:** Can extend beyond individual proteins to predict how proteins interact.
> 
> In summary, co-evolution provides structural constraints that guide modern protein structure prediction methods, especially in cases where direct experimental data is lacking.

### Additional constraints

- From NMR, CyroEM, or contact prediction methods
- Sometimes can be alternative to constraints provided by homology modeling

### Accuracy

1. Homology detection
2. Fold recognition
3. Coarse constraints
4. Ab initio

## Domains

- Structure prediction methods work well at the [domains](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/1.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction.md#Protein%20domains) level.

### Domain splitting

- Domain splitting can be ambiguous:
	- Non-trivial to define where a domain begins and ends
	- Multiple definitions of what a domain is
- Multiple templates may be needed to model the structure for a single target sequence

### Domain orientation

- Resolving the orientation of modeled domains with respect to each other is an unsolved problem, unless there is a suitable, homologous, _template_ available where the domains have the same orientation.
- _Coarse constraints_ on domain orientation, such as data from small-angle scattering experiments, distance restraints from NMR, chemical cross-links or co-evolutionary relationships can help to put different homology models in the correct orientation.

## Assessing the quality of structure prediction methods

- The test set should be independent of the training set and also contain no _homologs_
- However, another problem is that getting the test set from the experimentally determinable structures are already biased. It does not represent the complete spectrum of protein structure in nature -> cannot know how well the method generalizes for all kinds of unknown structures.

### Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction

- [CASP](https://predictioncenter.org/): a competition to benchmark structure prediction algorithms; uses soon-to-be resolved protein structure as questions.
- Different categories of problems.
- Most up-to-date indicator of method performance.

### Comparing structures

- Assess the quality of a prediction method
- Compare the atomic coordinates of predicted and true structures and quantify their similarity
- Before comparing, the predicted and true structures need to be aligned
	- Trivial because they have the same amino acid sequence

#### RMSD

- Root mean square deviation (RMSD)
	- deviation measures difference between true and predicted coordinates
- Sensitive to outliers
	- For example, if prediction for a loop is very wrong because loops are harder to predict but the other structures are well-aligned, the RMSD would still be very high.

#### GDT_TS

- Global distance test total score (GDT-TS)
- Count the number of residues that can be maximally fitted within a certain distance cutoff.
- $$\text{GDT\_TS}=\frac{1}{4}\sum_{v=1,2,4,8\mathrm{Å}}\frac{G(v)}{t}$$, where $G(v)$ is the number of aligned residues within given RMSD cutoff $v$, and $t$ is the total number of aligned residues. The score is an average of 4 distance cutoffs.
- GDT_HA: stricter cutoffs (0.5, 1, 2, 4 Å); for [Homology modeling](#Homology%20modeling) categories where very high accuracies can be achieved.
- For problems without good template structures, prediction is still very difficult. GDT_TS < 20% is common.

### How difficult it is to predict

- With a good template
	- Very high, > 50%
	- Very good predictions for the aligned regions
	- Hard to predict the gaps, which usually lie in loops
- No template
	- Ab initio modeling uses small templates from various proteins to assemble a structure
	- A passable prediction may exist in the top five to ten predicted models, but it may not be the one with the highest score of the prediction program
	- Accuracy ranges between 20% to 40%

### For which gene sequences can we predict a 3d structure

- Reliable structures can only be predicted when there is a structure of a homologous protein present in the [PDB](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/1.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction.md#PDB). Based on this notion, we can then estimate for which fraction of gene sequences it is possible to predict a structure.
- For about 44% of residues in Eukaryotic gene sequences we _cannot_ make a homology model
	- Membrane proteins are underrepresented in PDB
	- Many residues exist in [natively disordered regions](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/1.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction.md#^fa1a21)

### How accurate do we need to be

- Accuracy needed depends on the biological question
- Sometimes full structure prediction is _not necessary_:
	- directly predicting mutation impact: HOPE (Venselaar et al., 2010)
	- direct prediction of protein-protein interaction sites: SeRenDIP (Hou et al., 2017)
- Sometimes a _rough homology model_ suffices to obtain some insight
- For enzymes, structure modeling should be done in combination with the structure of the ligand.
- Protein structural models are regularly used for the prediction of protein-protein interactions or protein-ligand interactions by docking.

## Sequence to folding is not a 1-to-1 solution

- Think of folding into an ensemble of structures.
- Which structure it finally takes depends on many factors. ex. presence of binding partners, the pressure, pH, temperature, etc.
- Sometimes the functional or biologically relevant structural ensembles do not resemble a single globular folded structure.

### Intrinsically disordered proteins

- These proteins are natively unfolded. They can take a large variety of more _extended_, and very _different_ configurations.
- Some disordered regions contain elements that do form stable structures upon _binding_.
- The regions that remain disordered are thought to be important to prevent _aggregation_ within the cell.
- Disordered regions can be predicted from protein sequence:
	- Signature: a large amount of charged/polar (_hydrophilic_) amino acids in combination with the presence of amino acids that disrupt the secondary structure (proline and glycine) in these regions.
- Disordered segments exist in many protein sequences: 33% of eukaryotic, 2% archaeal, and 4% bacterial proteins.

### Allostery and functional structural ensembles

- Proteins can fold into _multiple functional states_ depending on the context.
- Most proteins are only crystallized in one state, and the functional context of the state is _unknown_.
- One may have cases where a homology model of the relevant state may be preferred over a crystal structure of a different or unknown state.

### Aggregated state

- Instead of folding, proteins can become aggregated. 
- An example is the amyloid fibrils, implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases.
	- Formed by aggregated $\beta$-strands formed between different protein or peptide chains
	- Selected against by evolution: extremely rare to see solvent exposed $\beta$-strand edges or large hydrophobic surface patches to prevent binding to other proteins.
- [Propensity](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/3.%20VU%20SB%20Protein%20Folding.md#Propensity) of proteins forming amyloid fibrils is relatively easy to predict, but reference databases are still small so it is diﬃcult to verify such methods.
