# Umbrella sampling continued

## Thermodynamics

 - There are **many paths** between the folded and the unfolded state, even for a simple 2D lattice model
 - Simulation: _RMSD to original_ shows protein fold and unfold continuously
	 - many different folded and unfolded conformations
 - What if _all_ states were visited during folding
	 - basically, takes forever
	 - in reality, protein folding is really fast
	 - number of _relevant_ non-folded structures is much smaller than the number of possible non-folded structures
		 - protein has a way to navigate the free energy landscape

## Shaw et. al. paper

> Atomic-Level Characterization of the Structural Dynamics of Proteins

- Why folding and unfolding are slower (simulation runs in $\micro s$ range): protein is _bigger_, more atoms to move together

### Questions

- What is the transition state in protein folding for a two-state folder? and what is meant by TSE?
	- a state between 2 minima
	- the tip of the barrier
	- in experiment it is unlikely to observe because its probability is low due to high free energy
- Transition of the ensemble: watch lecture again...
- In figure 2A, what is the state of the protein (folded or unfolded) in the RMSD range between 0.5 - 2.5 Å
	- folded state
- what is between 7.5 to 12 Å
	- unfolded state
- why so few sampling between the two?
	- transition state
- What does it mean for the physical system
	- the protein stays in the local minima (folded or unfolded states) most of the time
