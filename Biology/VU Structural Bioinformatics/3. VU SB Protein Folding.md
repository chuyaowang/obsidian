## A paper: How sticky are our proteins? Quantifying hydrophobicity of the human proteome

> [Paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/2/1/vbac002/6515307)
> why are we learning a paper with 18 citations from a IF 2.4 journal?

### Summary

- Normally proteins fold hydrophobic residues to the center
- Exposed hydrophobic residues have a function role
- Paper:
	- Quantifies surface hydrophobicity in 3 ways
	- Predict these measures from sequence: NetSurfP2.0
	- Predict hydrophobicity of human proteins in diseases and tissues; analyze hydrophobicity relation to expression value (change a proteome and it's a new paper, uh; why not just use structure data)

### Why hydrophobic residues are exposed

- Exposed hydrophobic residues cause proteins to be more sticky
- To interact with:
	- Membranes
	- Ligands
	- Other proteins
- Example: exposed hydrophobic residues play a role in formation and stabilization of amyloid fibrils (neurodegenerative diseases). Burying inside prevents aggregation.

### Quantify hydrophobicity

- **Total hydrophobic surface area (THSA)**: total area of hydrophobic residues on the surface
	- With PDB 3d structure, this can be calculated using DSSP
- **Relative hydrophobic surface area (RHSA)**: THSA divided by total accessible surface area (TASA)
	- Also can be calculated with DSSP with PDB 3d structure
- **Largest hydrophobic patch (LHP)**: the largest area of adjacent area of hydrophobic residues 
	- A method called MolPatch developed and used
	- Biological relevance determined using PiSITE database: large patches serve as protein-protein interaction sites.
- Not always correlated; so important to have all 3

### Filtered PDB structures

- PISCES: a public server for culling sets of protein sequences from the PDB by sequence identity and structural quality criteria.
- Filtered multimeric and transmembrane proteins. Their hydrophobic patches are likely not exposed.
	- HMM method used to identify transmembrane protein

### MolPatch

- Protein 3d structure
- Creates a point cloud on the protein surface
- Point classified as hydrophilic or hydrophobic based on the closet residue
- Edges between hydrophobic points are retained. This creates hydrophobic patches
- Calculate area of grids of hydrophobic residues

### ML methods

- Models trained to predict [surface hydrophobicity measures](#Quantify%20hydrophobicity) from protein features or sequence
- Three feature model (TFM): 3 features
- Global feature model (GFM): 21 features
- NetSurfP2.0: predicts accessible surface area from sequence
	- no training done; directly used (questionable approach)
	- CNN and LSTM 
	- prediction used to calculate THSA and RSHA
- Random forest built from THSA and RSHA to predict LHP (only 2 features?)
- Sketchy prediction error definitions. Probably to make the numbers look better. Why not just RMSE?
	- Low accuracy for when error rate is low. LHP prediction practically does not work.
- TFM and GFM seem too simple to be compared with neural network based model.
- Entire section feels forced to add content to the paper. Could've used alphafold structures directly to calculate surface hydrophobicity. Probably less error that way.

### Predicted surface hydrophobicity of human proteome sequence

- Figure: why the predicted values not normalized for comparison?
- Human proteome sequences filtered to match the training data - really generalizable?
	- Data curation, euphemism for data cherrypicking
- Why two peaks for LHP: two trans-membrane domain sizes:
	- A single helix: small, ~2000 A
		- Does not crystallize because part outside membrane is unstable
	- A transmembrane domain: large, ~6500 A

### Sticky proteins are not highly expressed

- The highest gene expression value among all tissues selected for each gene - could be outliers, exaggerate difference.
- Gene expression not perfectly representative of protein level.
- Why group expression values rather than just use a correlation coefficient?
- Also used median expression value across all tissues; shows a similar trend
- Proteins that have large surface hydrophobicity and highly expressed are often protein subunits forming complexes.

### GSEA for tissue type and disease

- Tissue specificity
- High expression of sticky proteins related to aggregation diseases.

### Dihedral angles

- Phi and psi angles
	- Calculated from atomic coordinates as angle between 2 planes; see assignment 1 code
	- Phi: previous C, N, CA, C
	- Psi: N, CA, C, next N
- Ramachandran plots
	- Plot to view distributions of phi and psi angles
	- Only specific combinations possible due to steric hindrance
- Can be calculated from DSSP

### Surface accessible area

- de van der Waals surface
- Also can be calculated from DSSP

### Propensity

- The propensity for a residue is the preference of an amino acid for a secondary structure. 
- An odds ratio.
- It can be defined as $$\frac{P(aa)_{SS}}{P(total)_{SS}}$$, where $P(aa)_{SS}$ is the percentage of the amino acid $aa$ that is in secondary structure $SS$, and $P(total)_{SS}$ is the percentage of all residues that are in secondary structure $SS$.
-  $$P(aa)_{SS} = \frac{N(aa)_{SS}}{N(aa)}$$, where $N(aa)_{SS}$ is the number of ${aa}$ in ${SS}$, and $N(aa)$ is the total number of $aa$, 
- $$P(total)_{SS} = \frac{N(total)_{SS}}{N(total)}$$, where $N(total)_{SS}$ is the number of all residues that are in $SS$, and $N(total)$ is the total number of residues
- Propensities for other features, such as propensity to be on the surface of protein, can also be calculated.

### Protein stability

- Protein stability: depends on temperature, pH, salt concentration, and crowding agents.
- What effective forces make the protein fold?
	- Electrostatic forces
	- Hydrogen bond
	- van der Waals
	- Entropic effects
	- Hydrophobic effect

### Hydrophobic effect

- [Entropy (Information Theory)](Entropy%20(Information%20Theory).md)
- High entropy is _thermodynamically favorable_
- Low energy is _energetically favorable_
- Maximizing the number of hydrogen bonds means being in a more _energetically favorable_ state -> limits the number of viable conformations of the protein -> entropy **loss** for the protein
- Unfolded protein disrupts the hydrogen bonding network of water -> water forms cage-like structure around it -> entropy **loss** for water
- When the protein is folded, the disruption is minimized -> entropy **gain** for water
- The gain in entropy of water outweighs the loss in entropy for the protein, so protein is folded.
- Trade-off of being in an energetically favorable (low enthalpy) vs. a thermodynamically favorable (high entropy) state.
	- A low energy but low entropy state
	- A high energy but high entropy state
- High entropy is favorable because it allows for more conformations for the system to be in. The system can get into different conformations because of the constant movement of atoms.

> [!info]- Entropy and enthalpy
> The concepts of being **energetically favorable** and **thermodynamically favorable** are closely related but distinct. They both contribute to the stability of a system, such as a protein in its folded state, but they do so in different ways. Here's how they balance each other:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 1. Energetically Favorable (Enthalpy-Driven)
> 
>    - An energetically favorable process is one that lowers the **enthalpy (H)** of the system, typically by forming favorable interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces).
>    - In protein folding, energetically favorable interactions include:
>      - Formation of hydrogen bonds within the protein backbone and side chains.
>      - Van der Waals interactions in the tightly packed hydrophobic core.
>      - Ionic interactions (salt bridges) between charged amino acids.
>    - These interactions release energy, making the system more stable.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Thermodynamically Favorable (Entropy-Driven)
> 
>    - A thermodynamically favorable process is one that increases the **entropy (S)** of the system or its surroundings, or both. Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness.
>    - In protein folding, the hydrophobic effect is a key entropy-driven process:
>      - When hydrophobic amino acids are sequestered in the protein's core, water molecules that were ordered around these hydrophobic regions are released, increasing the entropy of the water.
>    - The increase in entropy of the surroundings (water) makes the process thermodynamically favorable.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. Balancing Energetics and Thermodynamics
> 
>    - The stability of a system, such as a folded protein, is determined by the **Gibbs free energy (ΔG)**, which combines both enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS):
>      $$
>      \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
>      $$
>      - For a process to be spontaneous (thermodynamically favorable), ΔG must be negative.
>    - In protein folding:
>      - **Enthalpy (ΔH)**: The formation of favorable interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces) lowers the enthalpy (ΔH < 0), making the process energetically favorable.
>      - **Entropy (ΔS)**: The release of ordered water molecules during hydrophobic core formation increases the entropy of the surroundings (ΔS > 0), making the process thermodynamically favorable.
>    - The balance between these two factors determines whether protein folding occurs spontaneously:
>      - If the decrease in enthalpy (ΔH < 0) and/or the increase in entropy (ΔS > 0) are large enough, ΔG will be negative, and the process will be spontaneous.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. Trade-Offs in Protein Folding
> 
>    - Protein folding involves trade-offs between enthalpy and entropy:
>      - **Enthalpy**: The protein gains stability by forming favorable interactions, but this often requires the protein to adopt a more ordered (lower entropy) conformation.
>      - **Entropy**: The system gains entropy by releasing ordered water molecules, but this requires the protein to fold into a specific structure, which reduces its conformational entropy.
>    - The balance between these opposing factors is what determines the native, folded state of the protein.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 5. Example: Hydrophobic Effect
> 
>    - The hydrophobic effect is a classic example of how entropy and enthalpy balance:
>      - **Entropy Gain**: When hydrophobic amino acids are buried in the protein's core, water molecules are released, increasing the entropy of the surroundings (thermodynamically favorable).
>      - **Enthalpy Loss**: The hydrophobic core itself does not form strong favorable interactions, but the overall protein structure stabilizes through other interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces).
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> Being energetically favorable (lower enthalpy) and thermodynamically favorable (higher entropy) are complementary processes that balance each other to stabilize a system. In protein folding:
> - Energetically favorable interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces) lower the enthalpy.
> - The hydrophobic effect and other entropy-driven processes increase the entropy of the surroundings.
> - The balance between these factors determines the overall Gibbs free energy (ΔG), making protein folding spontaneous and stable when ΔG < 0.

> [!info]- Why high entropy is thermodynamically favorable
> High entropy is thermodynamically favorable because of the **Second Law of Thermodynamics**, which states that the total entropy of a system and its surroundings always increases for a spontaneous process. Entropy (S) is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system, and systems naturally tend to evolve toward states with higher entropy. Here's why high entropy is favorable:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 1. Second Law of Thermodynamics
> 
>    - The Second Law states that for any spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe (system + surroundings) must increase:
>      $$
>      \Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} > 0
>      $$
>    - A process is thermodynamically favorable (spontaneous) if it leads to an increase in the total entropy of the universe.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Entropy and Disorder
> 
>    - Entropy is often described as a measure of disorder. A system with high entropy has more possible microstates (ways to arrange its components) and is therefore more disordered.
>    - Nature tends to favor states with higher entropy because they are statistically more probable. There are far more ways for a system to be disordered than ordered.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. Thermodynamic Favorability and Gibbs Free Energy
> 
>    - The favorability of a process is determined by the **Gibbs free energy (ΔG)**:
>      $$
>      \Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
>      $$
>      - ΔH: Change in enthalpy (heat content of the system).
>      - T: Temperature (in Kelvin).
>      - ΔS: Change in entropy.
>    - For a process to be spontaneous, ΔG must be negative (ΔG < 0).
>    - A positive change in entropy (ΔS > 0) contributes to a negative ΔG, making the process thermodynamically favorable.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 4. Why High Entropy is Favorable
> 
>    - **Increased Microstates**: High entropy means there are more ways for the system to arrange itself, which corresponds to a higher probability of the system being in that state.
>    - **Energy Dispersion**: High entropy is associated with the dispersal of energy. Systems tend to evolve toward states where energy is more evenly distributed, which corresponds to higher entropy.
>    - **Stability**: A state with high entropy is more stable because it is less constrained and has more accessible configurations.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 5. Examples of High Entropy Being Favorable
> 
>    - **Mixing of Gases**: When two gases mix, the entropy of the system increases because the molecules have more possible arrangements. This is why gases spontaneously mix.
>    - **Melting of Ice**: When ice melts into liquid water, the entropy increases because water molecules have more freedom to move and arrange themselves.
>    - **Protein Folding and the Hydrophobic Effect**: In protein folding, the release of ordered water molecules around hydrophobic regions increases the entropy of the surroundings, making the process thermodynamically favorable.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 6. Entropy in Biological Systems
> 
>    - In biological systems, entropy plays a crucial role in processes like protein folding, membrane formation, and chemical reactions.
>    - For example, the hydrophobic effect in protein folding is driven by the increase in entropy of water molecules when hydrophobic amino acids are sequestered in the protein's core.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> High entropy is thermodynamically favorable because:
> 1. It aligns with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the universe tends toward greater disorder.
> 2. High entropy corresponds to a greater number of microstates, making the state more probable and stable.
> 3. A positive change in entropy (ΔS > 0) contributes to a negative Gibbs free energy (ΔG < 0), making processes spontaneous.
> 
> In essence, nature favors high entropy because it represents a more dispersed, disordered, and statistically likely state.

> [!info]- Why loops are exposed and helices and strands are buried
> The explanation lies in the interplay of intramolecular interactions, solvent effects, and the resulting free‐energy changes during folding. Consider the free‐energy change ΔG = ΔH – TΔS that governs folding:
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Helices and Sheets**
> 
> **Enthalpy (ΔH):**
> 
> - **Formation of Regular Hydrogen Bonds:**  
>     In helices and sheets, the protein backbone forms a systematic network of hydrogen bonds (e.g., the i → i+4 hydrogen bonds in α-helices or the extended network in β-sheets).
> - **Protection from Water Interference:**  
>     These hydrogen bonds are most stable when shielded from water, which would otherwise compete for bonding. Buried environments reduce such competition, allowing these bonds to contribute strongly to lowering the enthalpy.
> 
> **Entropy (ΔS):**
> 
> - **Conformational Ordering vs. Solvent Release:**  
>     Although establishing regular secondary structures limits the conformational freedom of the backbone (a loss in chain entropy), this loss is offset by the release of ordered water molecules. When backbone polar groups that were previously interacting with water become internally hydrogen-bonded, water molecules are freed, increasing the solvent’s entropy.
> - **Net Free-Energy Benefit:**  
>     The combination of a favorable enthalpic contribution (from stable hydrogen bonds in a low-dielectric, water-excluded environment) and the solvent entropy gain makes the burial of these structured elements thermodynamically favorable.
> 
> **Chemical Properties (Beyond Side Chain Hydrophobicity):**
> 
> - **Optimized Bonding Geometry:**  
>     The backbone polar groups are arranged in such a way that, once organized into helices or sheets, they can satisfy their hydrogen-bonding potential most effectively in an environment that minimizes disruptive interactions with water.
> - **Energetic Need for Shielding:**  
>     Even independent of side-chain effects, the intrinsic drive to form and maintain these regular hydrogen bonds is a key factor. Burying these elements helps maintain their integrity and maximizes the stabilizing energy from these interactions.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Turns and Loops**
> 
> **Enthalpy (ΔH):**
> 
> - **Lack of Extensive Regular Hydrogen Bonds:**  
>     Turns and loops do not form extensive, regular hydrogen bonding networks. Their transient or irregular hydrogen bonds are not as energetically stabilizing. Without the strong intramolecular bonding benefit, there is less enthalpic drive to protect them from water.
> 
> **Entropy (ΔS):**
> 
> - **High Conformational Flexibility:**  
>     Turns and loops are inherently flexible and dynamic. Their structural freedom means they contribute significantly to the conformational entropy of the protein.
> - **Cost of Restricting Flexibility:**  
>     Burying these regions would force them into a more ordered state, incurring a substantial entropic penalty. Since there isn’t a compensatory enthalpic gain (as they lack regular, strong hydrogen bonding), it is thermodynamically unfavorable to bury them.
> 
> **Chemical Properties (Intrinsic to Their Role):**
> 
> - **Adaptability to Solvent Exposure:**  
>     The amino acids in loops and turns are often positioned so they can interact favorably with the solvent. This exposure may also be functionally important, for example, in ligand binding or facilitating conformational changes.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### **Summary**
> 
> - **Helices and Sheets:**  
>     Their regular, intramolecular hydrogen bonding network drives a significant enthalpic gain, which is maximized when these structures are buried away from water. The burial also liberates water molecules (increasing solvent entropy), compensating for the loss of conformational entropy in the backbone. This makes the buried state of helices and sheets thermodynamically favorable.
>     
> - **Turns and Loops:**  
>     Lacking extensive hydrogen bonding, these regions do not gain much enthalpic benefit from being buried. Instead, their intrinsic flexibility (high conformational entropy) is best preserved when they remain solvent-exposed, where water can interact without imposing strict conformational restraints.
>     
> 
> Thus, independent of the residue composition, the driving forces—favorable enthalpy from hydrogen bonds that need a water-free environment and the overall entropy balance involving solvent ordering—explain why helices and sheets tend to be buried while turns and loops remain exposed.
