Chapter 13 from book âœ…

## Summarize chapter 12

- Define a _free energy landscape_ for the _conformational space_ ([State Space](Biology/VU%20Introduction%20to%20Systems%20Biology/2.%20VU%20ISB%20State%20Space.md)) of a protein
- The states with the _lowest_ free energy is the most _probable_, and because the molecule spend the most time in the most probable state, it is considered the most _stable_ state
- Define the _native state_ as the most stable state of the protein

## Dynamic equilibrium of protein folding

- Different states of protein (unfolded and folded) reach a dynamic [equilibrium state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc): $$F\overset{v}\leftrightharpoons U$$, where $F$ refers to the folded state, and $U$ refers to the unfolded state.
- At equilibrium, at the system level, $f$ and $u$ (concentrations of $F$ and $U$)are constant, and $v=0$.
- However, microscopically, individual proteins can still fold and unfold.

## Classical vs. statistical thermodynamics

- **Classical** thermodynamics
	- describe **macroscopic** properties of the system, such as distribution of energy in a pot of warm water
	- does not consider **microscopic** fluctuations: folding and unfolding of individual protein molecules
- **Statistical** thermodynamics
	- describes how fluctuations at the microscopic (molecular) level of the system lead to the macroscopic behaviors that can be observed in experiments


$$
p_{i}=\frac{e^{-E_{i}/k_{B}T}}{\sum_{i}e^{-E_{i}/k_{B}T}}
$$
$$
\Omega_{A}=\frac{N!}{k_{A}!(N-k_{A})!}
$$

observation ->(HMM or DL) state -> (simulation) most likely combination of states
- from observation, predict state using HMM or deep learning or simple ML
	- VAE: predict latent variables (states) from observations (omics data) by reconstruction
	- latent variables as parameters of HMM?
- enhances prediction by MC simulation of the network
	- constraints exist in nature
		- state of molecules in the network can be inferred from/ are constrained by the states of other states
		- for example, if a TF has high expression, a gene downstream would be regulated and have high/low expression. - correlation
	- use the loss and constraints to do gradient descent
- maximizes likelihood of all states p(states|observation) / minimizes the total free energy in simulation

F_{i}\propto -k_{B}T\ln(p_{i})
