## ​Introduction to molecular dynamics

- Many protein have **functional motions**
	- For example, binding of oxygen to hemoglobin induces a conformational change that makes subsequent oxygen binding more favorable.
- However, such small conformational changes are hard to observe, except:
	- Proteins are crystallized in multiple distinct conformations
	- Fluorescence experiments capture fast changes
	- Time resolved crystal structures are recorded
- **Molecular dynamics**: simulation of molecular motions
	- Use: forces and interactions between particles
	- Give: motions in 3 dimensions over a certain time scale
