## Forces of protein folding

- [Hydrophobic effect](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/3.%20VU%20SB%20Protein%20Folding.md#Hydrophobic%20effect)
- electrostatic interactions: salt bridges
- hydrogen bonds form 2nd structure
- van del waals forces

## Entropy

- [Entropy (Information Theory)](Machine%20Learning/Concepts/Entropy%20(Information%20Theory).md)
- [Hydrophobic effect](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/3.%20VU%20SB%20Protein%20Folding.md#Hydrophobic%20effect)
- $$S=k_B\ln{\Omega}$$, where $S$ is entropy, $k_B$ is Boltzmann constant, $\Omega$ is the number of microscopic configurations
- Microstate vs. state:
	- Microstates are different configurations of a state that are indistinguishable from the outside
- Entropy of the crystal structure: 0, only 1 configuration

## Simple model for protein folding

- **Hydrophobic polar**
- Plot AA chain in a 2D grid, consider them only as polar and hydrophobic residues
- Different states with different numbers of interactions between hydrophobic residues - assume hydrophobic effect is a force between hydrophobic residues
- Interactions: defined as 2 residues being next to each other in a grid without being connected by a bond
- Interaction matrix: favorable interaction between hydrophobic-hydrophobic and polar-polar residues

## Why proteins fold

- Anfinsen's theorem: primary sequence determines tertiary structure
- Consider protein folding as an [equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc) process: in equilibrium proteins both fold and unfold. The most stable configuration (lowest **free energy**) is most likely.
- Free energy landscape: 
	- hills and valleys of high free energy and low free energy
	- lower free energy -> more stable protein -> higher probability (P) to observe this state
- The RMSD to native: a measure to quantify the state of the protein (folded vs unfolded)  
based on the configuration of the chain.

### Free energy

- Free energy is defined as: $$F=H-TS$$
	- where H is enthalpy (energy of the state: kinetic, potential, heat, interaction energies)
	- T: temperature
	- S: entropy
	- As T increases, S becomes _more dominant_ for the stability

### Chain entropy

- The possible number of backbone configurations
- Much larger in unfolded state compared to the folded state

### What forces destabilize a folded protein 

- chain entropy: chain prefers higher entropy state
- high temperature: protein denaturing

### Free energy and temperature

- Plot demonstrates reversible protein folding in different temperature conditions.
- At lower temperatures the protein stays more in the folded state in a 50 ns period
- Free energy landscape changes in response to the temperature: at a higher temperature, free energy landscape becomes favorable of the unfolded state.

### Protein folding as a 'two-state' process

- In the folded state, some protein molecules can unfold
- In the unfolded state, some protein molecules can refold
- To change to the other state, the **transition state** 'hill' needs to be climbed. If the hill is higher, the probability of changing to the other state is lower.
	- The transition state refers to the top of the hill
- The more probable state has _fewer_ molecules transitioning to the other state, the less probable state has _more_ molecules transitioning to the other state
- A dynamic equilibrium is established: $\text{Unfolded} \leftrightharpoons \text{Folded}$

## Folding in the cell

### Chaperones

- Aid protein folding

### Co-translational folding

- Co-translational folding allows proteins to fold efficiently as they are synthesized on the ribosome, reducing the likelihood of misfolded intermediates that can arise post-translationally.
- Proteins can begin forming subdomain structures co-translationally, which improves folding efficiency and helps commit misfolding-prone domains to their native state.
- There is evidence of evolutionary selection for optimal translation kinetics, such as the use of rare codons, to _enhance co-translational folding_ and avoid _misfolding traps_.

### Alternative folding: prions

- Found in brains
- Function unknown
- Two forms
	- normal alpha-structure
	- haraful beta-structures
- beta-structure can aggregate and form plaques
	- blocks certain tissues and functions in the brains
	- very hard to reverse once the fibers start forming

### Beta strands & amyloid formation

- [Aggregated state](Biology/VU%20Structural%20Bioinformatics/4.%20VU%20SB%20Introduction%20to%20Structure%20Prediction.md#Aggregated%20state)
- from beta-strands

### Protein flexibility 

- the native state is heterogeneous
- also a correctly folded protein is dynamic
	- crystal structure yields _average position_ of the atoms
	- average of a distribution of possible motions of the folded protein

### Conformational changes

- [6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/6.%20VU%20BMBN%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%20for%20Effector%20Binding.md)
- effectors binding changes protein conformation

### Allosteric control

- [7. VU BMBN Multimeric Enzyme Kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md)
- Tense and relaxed state controlled by binding to the allosteric site

### Active protein conformation

- Native state refers to the protein in its active form
- To denature
	- High temperature
	- High pressure
	- High concentration of denaturant
- Active and denatured state forms equilibrium in water
