## Reported data

- Two values are reported for each channel: FSC, SSC, YFP420, RFP488, RFP560, Far-red 560
	- H: heights
	- A: area

## Recommended combinations to tag multiple proteins in yeast

## Caveats

- photo multiplier: set by the gain
- Gain of each detector can be set separately. Hence gain of each detector cannot be compared. Also data from different flow cytometers cannot be compared unless calibrated.
- Fluorescence can correlate with cell size
	- Convert into fluorescence concentration by _dividing by forward scatter_
- Negative values can arise as an artifact of background fluorescence correction
