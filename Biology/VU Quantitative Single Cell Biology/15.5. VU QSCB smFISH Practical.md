# smFISH Practical

## Cultures

- YET858: wild type
	- glucose 2%, growht overnight until OD600 ~ 0.4 -> galactose 2% 3 hours
	- raffinose 2% growth overnight until OD600 ~ 0.4 -> galactose 0.2% 30 min
	- why shorter time and less concentration: reduce signal strength
	- background fluorescence can still be detected

## Multiplex smFISH

- Use multiple fluorophore probes
- GAL1 mRNA is induced in presence of galactose
- DOA1 mRNA is constitutively expressed and represents our control mRNA
- Experiment done on fixed cells

## Fixation of cells

- 4% paraformaldehyde

Cross-linking method: In this method, paraformaldehyde is depolymerized to  
formaldehyde solution by water in the presence of a base, an acid or heat.  
Yeast media is acidic ~pH 5.5.  
The formaldehyde solution is used to form covalent chemical bonds (or cross-  
links) between proteins and protein-nucleic acids in a cell. This method usually  
provides the best preservation, especially of soluble proteins, DNA and RNAs.  
The drawback of fixation is that it can also ‘mask’ your antigens or RNA that you  
want to detect.  
To fix by cross-linking, yeast cells are incubated with 4% formaldehyde solution  
for 45 minutes with gentle mixing.


- Cell centrifuging
- Digestion of the cell walls for yeast
- poly-lysine coating of glass coverslips
- plating of cells on coated coverslips, cells attachment at 4 degs for 1 hour
- 70% ethanol, storage at -20 deg for months
- hybridization of cells with fluorescent probes at 37 degs for 3 hrs; wash excess probes mounting on glass cover  slides
- imaging on wide-field microscopy

## Microscope

### Olympus BX63

- Camera
- Fluorescence light source: LED lamp
- Apo-chromatic 100x objective lens, 1.35NA (? apo-chromatic)
- Transmitted light source (tungsten-halogen lamp) for bright field or DIC (differential inference contrast)

### Camera

- Hamamatsu Orca Fusion
- 2304x2304 pixels
- Each pixel 6.5x6.5 $\mu m$
- Combined with an 100x objective
- Each pixel in your image equals to 65 nm

### Image acquisition

- Scanning along the z axis
- Most intensity at the focal plane
- By measuring change in fluorescence can tell where is the image in the sample
- DAPI 50 ms, DOA1 750 ms Quasar 570, GAL1 750 ms Quasar 670

### Spots localization by image sectioning and 3D Gaussian fitting

- On the z axis there is less resolution than x and y axes


## Multiple layers of GAL gene expression: bistability and bimodality

- GAL1 magenta, DAPI blue
- Glucose -> Galactose: bimodality, 2 groups of cells after switching to galactose
- Raffinose -> Galactose: unimodality, 1 group of cells after switching to galactose (all GAL1 activated)
