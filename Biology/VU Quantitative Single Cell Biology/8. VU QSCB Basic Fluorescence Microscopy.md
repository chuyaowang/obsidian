## Important concepts in microscopy

- **Magnification**: the ability to make an object larger
- **Resolution**: the ability to distinguish two adjacent objects as separate and distinct (ability to capture more details)
- **Contrast**: the difference in brightness or color that makes an object distinguishable

### History

- First microscope: around 1595 by Zacharia Jansen or (most likely) by his neighbor Hans Lippershey to examine fabric. Around 9 fold magnification.
	- Later improved by Galileo (microscope and telescope are essentially the same)
- First biological microscope: in 1664 by Robert Hooke to study a flea and many other cells. Around 30 fold magnification.
- Antoni van Leeuwenhoek: made an improvement to see bacteria, red blood cells, and swimming sperm cells.

### Modern microscope

- Uses composite lenses to correct for artifacts
	- Objective, tube lens
- Magnification is inverted
- $F_{t}=$ 10 - 20 cm, depending on the manufacturer
- $F_{o}=$ 2-40 mm
- $M = \frac{F_{t}}{F_{o}}=$ up to 100x fold

## Resolution

### Light is an electromagnetic wave

- A wave in electric and magnetic field
- Wavelength $\lambda$: distance between two peaks
- Frequency : number of waves per second
- Typical wavelength of visible light: 400 - 750 nm
- Size of a large protein: ~ 0.01 $\lambda$

### Resolution is limited

- Resolution: the ability to distinguish two adjacent objects as separate and distinct (ability to capture more details)
- Due to the wave-nature of light, a point is imaged as a ring-pattern called airy disk or point-spread function (PSF).
	- Peak in the middle and ripples around it from interfering light waves

$$
\text{Radius Airy Disk}=\frac{0.61\cdot\lambda}{N.A}
$$

- If 2 objects are too close, their PSF in the image overlap and mix. Size of PSF is determined by the wavelength of light used and **numerical aperture** (N.A., light gathering power) of the objective.  
- Shorter wavelengths and higher NA objectives give smaller PSFs and hence better resolution.
- High NA objectives require immersion oil.

$$
\text{Resolution} = \text{Radius Airy Disk}=\frac{0.61\cdot\lambda}{N.A}=\pm 0.5 \lambda
$$

- 3 cases:
	- a) the objects cannot be separated. They appear to be one object.
	- b) resolution limit: the two objects can be discriminated when imaged and analyzed carefully. The peaks are now in each other's first minimum.
	- c) the two objects are well separated
- For the shortest $\lambda$ visible light (400 nm), the resolution limit is $\pm 0.2 \micro m$. This means that objects that are closer together than 0.2 $\mu m$ cannot be resolved as separate objects.
- This means that there are hundreds of molecules in a single spot
- How to know the number of objects in a single spot: brightness, bleaching
- Increase resolution: electron microscopy has shorter wavelength.

## Contrast

- To see an object in a microscope, it needs to be different from its environment. This is called contrast.
- For normal light microscopy, contrast is provided by absorption or reflection of visible light. In other words: you can only see objects that are colored.
- Most biological samples lack contrast.
- This is where fluorescence comes in useful.

### Why fluorescence

- **Contrast**: Each fluorescent molecule is a point source of light on a black background.
- Specificity: By binding a fluorophore to a specific target molecule, it is possible to follow specific molecules in space and time.
- Spectral properties: 
	- By spectral selection (filtering) it is possible to make multi-colour images
	- Spectrum can give more information (e.g. molecular interaction (FRET), pH, Ca- concentration)
- Sensitivity: It is possible to observe single molecules only by fluorescence.

## What is fluorescence

- Light is an electromagnetic wave

### Wavelength correlated to energy

- Wavelength, frequency, and speed
$$
\lambda \cdot v=c
$$
- Light is emitted in discrete quantities called photons
- The energy of a photon is equal to: $$
E=h\cdot v=h\cdot \frac{c}{\lambda}
$$, where $h$ is Planck's constant
- Energy is proportional to wavelength
- Higher wavelength - lower energy

### Light absorption by an atom

- An atom can absorb a photon if the energy of the photon matches a transition of an electron to a higher energy level. Atomic absorption spectra are line-spectra.
- When the electron falls back to its original level, the atom emits light.

### Light absorption by a molecule

- Molecules: shared electrons
- Atom absorption: discrete energy differences. Produces a line spectrum
- Molecules contain bonds that can vibrate and around which groups can rotate. The make coupled vibration-electronic (“vibronic”) transitions. Therefore molecules have Gaussian-like absorption spectra.
	- Rotational energy levels
	- Vibrational energy levels
	- Still have distinct electron energy levels

### Fluorescent molecules

- Most molecules return to the ground state via _heat_ exchange
- Only a limited number of molecules is fluorescent: they emit a _photon_
- Some components of cells (flavins) are naturally fluorescent
- In most biological applications, molecules of interest are specifically labelled with a fluorescent molecule:
	- by using an antibody that is coupled to a fluorescent organic dye;
	- by genetically fusing the protein of interest to a naturally fluorescent protein (GFP or a mutant of a different color like CFP, YFP or RFP);
	- by genetically fusing the protein of interest to an antibody fragment or a modified enzyme that binds to a fluorescent dye with very high affinity (halo-tag, snap-tag, dL5-tag);
	- by hybridization with an oligo-DNA probe coupled to a fluorescent dye.

### Short history of fluorescence

- Discovered by Sir George Gabriel Stokes

### Jablonski diagram

- X axis: wavelength

- Fluorescent molecules have the unique property that they cannot relax from $S_{1}$ to $S_{0}$ via vibration.
- $S_{1}$ remains populated for a few $ns$ before the excess energy is released by the emission of a photon.  
- The emitted light has _less_ energy than the absorbed light. This results in the typical shift to longer wavelengths, called the **Stokes-shift**.

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250610102223.png)

### How this is used in a fluorescence microscope

- Stokes' shift allows spectral separation of excitation light from fluorescence light, crucial for use of fluorescence in a microscope
- A **dichroic mirror** reflects light of specific wavelengths, and allows other wavelengths to pass.
- It is placed in the parallel path of a microscope and used to reflect excitation light towards the sample.
- Fluorescence coming from the sample has a longer wavelength and is allowed to pass towards the detector.

## Components of a fluorescence microscope

### Excitation sources

- Mercury or Xenon lamp
	- Advantage: relatively cheap; many colors  
	- Disadvantage: heat, cannot be focused in a small spot
- LEDs:
	- Advantage: intermediate price, narrow spectrum, more specific  
	- Disadvantage: difficult to focus in a small spot  
- Lasers:
	- Advantage: single wavelength, very bright, can be well focused  
	- Disadvantage: expensive

### Filters and dichroics

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250610103017.png)

- **exciter/excitation filter** (blue line in spectrum): should only transmit wanted exc. color & block the rest  
- **dichroic mirror / beam splitter** (green line in spectrum): should reflect the excitation colors and transmit fluorescence  
- **emission/barrier filter**(red line in spectrum): should only transmit fluorescence and block the rest

### Detectors: human eye

- Human eye is a very good detector
- Rods are more sensitive than cones, especially for green light: no color vision at low light
- Threshold of vision is the detection of only 100 photons (single GFP molecule)
- The eye has an incredible dynamic range of over 10 decades (> 30 bits)

### Detectors: digital cameras

- Digital camera’s (emCCD, sCMOS)
	- consist of an array of thousands to millions of detectors
	- CCD’s are very sensitive, very good signal/noise ratio, relatively slow (30-100 FPS max) and very expensive
	- sCMOS cameras (like the ones in consumer camera’s and phones) are less expensive, more pixels, faster. They are becoming better and better at sensitivity and S/N ratio.

### Detectors: point detectors

- Point detectors only give intensity; no space information (no image).
- PMT (photomultiplier tube) used in spectrophotometer and in confocal microscope.
- APD (avalanche photodiode) are smaller, more sensitive (particular for blue light), less noise. 
- APDs are very fast (ns); used for measuring fluorescence lifetimes.

### Fluorescence microscopy with a camera

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250610104810.png)

- Epi-widefield: Excitation light focused in back-focal plane (at f, but at the back) of the objective. This gives a _parallel_ excitation beam. Entire sample gets excited and imaged on the camera.
	- fast imaging (video)
	- background

### Fluorescence microscopy with a point detector

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250610104622.png)

- Excitation with a parallel light beam gives excitation in 1 point. Fluorescence is  “imaged” in the point detector.
	- very sensitive  
	- no image, very high excitation power (damage)
- To get an image: move the laser to scan the sample - **confocal microscopy**

#### Confocal microscopy

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250610104523.png)

- Confocal implies that excitation and detection are both focused at one and the same spot in the sample.
- In order to obtain an image, you need to _scan_ either the sample or the laser and make the image point-by-point. This is rather slow.
- Pinhole: blocks light from objects out-of-focus.
	- This enables 3D imaging
		- 2D scan with laser
		- Third dimension by moving sample up and down
		- Stack of 2D images
