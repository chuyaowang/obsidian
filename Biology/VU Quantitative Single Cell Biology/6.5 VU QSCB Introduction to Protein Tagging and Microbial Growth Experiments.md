## Why using yeast as a model organism

- Well studied and characterized
- Eukaryote
- Fast growing (1 doubling ~ 90 minutes)
- Many widely used commerically available yeast strain and plasmid collections

## Genome manipulation

- Making a gene modification cassette containing the desired modification. Then amplify it using PCR.
- Gene deletion
- Gene tagging
- Gene modification

- Yeast laboratory strains have been built to lack genes encoding essential amino acids or nucleobases (TRP, LEU, HIS, ADE, URA)
- Mutant organisms that requires a particular additional nutrient which the normal strain produces are called Auxotrophs.
- Auxotrophic yeast strains can be propagated only in media that contain the appropriate growth factor(s) by nutritional complementation.
- Yeast laboratory strains are usually haploid!

## Stain description

- Measure GAL genes expression under different carbon sources
- Strain YET911: GAL1 gene fused to mScarlet (red fluorescence protein, RFP) with GAL1 promoter
- How to test if changes in _fluorescence_ are specific for the presence of galactose?
	- Strain YET937: fuse RFP to a different gene (DOA1) with the DOA1 promoter
- How would you test which gene element in the GAL1 gene is responsible for the induction?
	- Strain YET938: fuse RFP to DOA1 with GAL1 promoter
	- Strain YET962: only RFP to GAL1 promoter
		- GAL1 gene deleted. Strain would not grow
	- Strain YET963: only RFP to DOA1 promoter
		- DOA1 gene deleted. Strain would still grow

### Conditions

|                         | Pre-culture condition    | Culture condition        |     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --- |
| constant                | SC medium + 2% glucose   | SC medium + 2% glucose   |     |
| constant                | SC medium + 2% raffinose | SC medium + 2% raffinose |     |
| constant                | SC medium + 2% galactose | SC medium + 2% galactose |     |
| transition/induction    | SC medium + 2% glucose   | SC medium + 2% galactose |     |
| transition/induction    | SC medium + 2% raffinose | SC medium + 2% galactose |     |
| transition/derepression | SC medium + 2% glucose   | SC medium + 2% raffinose |     |
| transition/repression   | SC medium + 2% raffinose | SC medium + 2% glucose   |     |
| transition/repression   | SC medium + 2% galactose | SC medium + 2% glucose   |     |
| transition/repression   | SC medium + 2% galactose | SC medium + 2% raffinose |     |
- derepression: raffinose metabolism is not repressed as much. Raffinose is cleaved into a low level of fructose
- SC medium: synthetic complete medium
