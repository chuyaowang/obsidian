# Chance event probabilities, tools, and tricks

## Cellular chance events

- intrinsic noise
- noise propagation
- noise in mRNA and protein partitioning at cell division
- heterogeneity in cell age
- Individual cells are different

## Random variables: continuous and discrete

- Think of events in cells and properties as random variables
- Discrete random variables: take on discrete values
- Continuous random variables: real values; cell length, generation time, concentration, etc.
- They both obey probability distributions, those of discrete random variables are probability mass functions and those of continuous random variables are called probability density functions

## Probability of a certain value of a random variable

- From observation

$$
P(X=x)=\frac{\text{number of observations of value x}}{\text{total number of observations}}
$$
- The frequentist approach
- Discrete: $$
P(X=x)=\frac{n_{x}}{\sum_{x}n_{x}}
$$
- Continuous:
	- In case of observations
		- make bins of width $\Delta x$: for example, one centimeter in distribution of human height
		- and calculate $P(X=x')=\frac{n_{x'}<x<x'+\Delta x}{\sum_{x'} n_{x'}<x<x'+\Delta x}$
	- in case of theoretical analysis
		- fill in 

### Continuous random variable example

- Normal distribution
- Bin size = 1
	- different algorithms to choose the right bin size
	- do not have to be the same size
- 10000 samples taken from normal distribution
- Probabilities of bins were calculated: areas under the pdf are calculated
- Example:
	- Prob(X > 40)
	- Prob(X < 40)
	- Prob(X-std < X < X+std): for normal distribution, 2/3 of the events fall in 1 std range

## Useful when thinking about probabilities

- Consider an event with prob $p$. For instance, stress-tolerant cells ocuur with prob $p$. How many cells should be observed before you find one? That number of observations is distributed according to a geometric distribution?

$$
\begin{align}
Prob(N_{o}=n_{o})&=(1-p)^{n_{o}-1}p \\
\langle n_{o} \rangle &= \frac{1}{p} \\
\langle \delta^2 n_{o}\rangle&=\sqrt{\frac{1-p}{p^2}}
\end{align}
$$

- $\langle n_{o} \rangle$: expected number of observations
- $\langle \delta^2 n_{o}\rangle$: variance of number of observations
- Note that when fill in 
- When you do not know the prob of an event. Assume a distribution. Make n observations. If the event is observed. Then you know the prob of the event must be lower than the assumed prob

## Calculating the means of a stochastic time series

- Stochastic series from observation or simulation
- Given a stochastic time series, how to calculate its mean
- How to calculate the prob of copy number = a particular number

### Example

- Gene with 2 states X and Y
$$
\begin{align}
X&\overset{1}\rightarrow Y\\
Y&\overset{2}\rightarrow X
\end{align}
$$

- What is more probable: observing X or Y
	- Which state does the gene spend more time in?
	- Sum the time it spends in X and Y
- What is the prob of copy number of X = 60
	- draw a line
	- sum the time of the 60 state
	- divide by the total simulation time

## Variable transformation of means and variances

- Indirect measurement example: temperature measured with mercury height
- Say random variable $Z$ depends on another random variable $X$ as $z=ax+b$
- Then: $$
\begin{align}
\langle z \rangle&=\langle ax+b \rangle=a\langle x \rangle+b \\
\langle \delta^2 z \rangle&=\langle \delta^2(ax+b) \rangle=a^2\langle \delta^2 z \rangle
\end{align}
$$
- Examples:
	- unit transformations (e.g. minutes to hours)
	- fluorescence of a population of cells is sum of all cells + background

### Deriving a variance equation using the rules

## Variance decomposition, the law of total variance

- Important for casual analysis of statistical data

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250613102557.png)

- Gene 1 vs. gene 2 expression
- Is there casual relation between gene 1 and gene 2?
- When gene 1 and gene 2 independent, why is there still correlation?
	- As cell grow in size, it needs to express more genes
	- twice as many between cell birth and cell division
	- So correlation happens due to cell size
- Correct for it: divide by cell volume and cell size
- Two types of variation in the data:
	- there is variation in gene 2 that varies with gene 1
	- there is variation in gene 2 that is independent from gene 1
- Decomposing the variance: the law of total variance
	- average dependent variation
	- average independent variation for all $n_{1}$
