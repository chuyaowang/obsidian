## What do we gain by studying gene expression in living cells

- To understand how cells dynamically respond to environmental changes by controlling mRNA and protein synthesis, localization, translation and degradation.  
- To detect transient and rapid events that we cannot see in fixed cells  
- If we study gene expression regulation with single-cell resolution we can measure population heterogeneity and cell-to-cell variability  
- We can also follow a single cell or a single molecule over time

## What are the technical requirements to measure gene  expression in living cells?

- Fluorescent labelling of mRNAs in vivo
- Optically compatible sample -> low auto-fluorescence
- Sensitive cameras (CCD/ sCMOS)
- Rapid sampling rate (33 frames/sec~video rate)
	- cells are moving when imaging live cells
- Wide-field fluorescence microscopes with high Numerical Aperture (NA) objectives

## Methods

### MS2 or PP7 systems

- Imaging single mRNAs in living cells
- Loops on mRNA that can be bound by fluorescent tags
- Loops are inserted by genetic manipulation
- Background fluorescence, but when they are bound to mRNA the color intensity is higher

### Fluorogenic RNAs

- Ligand + RNA aptamer
- Forms a fluorescent complex that binds to the target mRNA

### Molecular beacons

- Beacon binds to mRNA and activates fluorescence
- Problem:
	- beacons are large
	- cells need to be permeabilized to get the beacons in

### rCas9/dCas13

- dCas13-GFP protein + guide RNA binds to target RNA
- Fluorescence for the target RNA
- GFP would always be fluorescent, but when they are bound to mRNA the color intensity is higher

## MS2 and PP7 system

### MS2

- The Bacteriophage MS2 is an icosahedral single-stranded RNA virus
- Sequence specific RNA-protein interaction

### PP7

- Similar mechanism but from a different phage

### System

- The MS2 and PP7 ssytems can be used to tag endogenous mRNAs

## Kinetics of RNA transcription from a single gene

- Put loop to 5' end so translation is hindered and fluorescence can accumulate
- Fluorescence has a step response indicating time when transcription begins

## Kinetics of transcription by fluorescence fluctuation analysis

- integrated intensity (counts) vs. time
- stochastic modeling of fluctuation

## Measuring mRNA export dynamics

- fluorescence distribution in the cytoplasm vs. the nucleus

## mRNA imaging in live mice

- Reveal mRNA localization upon stimulation

## Measuring mRNA translation dynamics

- Tagging 

## The MS2 system reports the full cycle of mRNA expression

- Tag both ASH1 mRNA and Tub1 protein

## Summary

- The MS2 system and other similar reporters (e.g. PP7, Lambda N, BglG) allow to visualize individual mRNAs in living cells.
- Imaging gene expression in living cells provides temporal and spatial information in single-cells over time.
- Gene expression measurements in living cells have the potential to reveal how cells dynamically regulate this process in response to changing environments.
- The MS2 system can be used to monitor all the stages of gene expression (e.g. transcription, export, localization, translation and decay).
- Gene expression can be studied as an integrated process in individual cells.
- Current research is focused on improving methods that allow the simultaneous detection of mRNA and proteins in single cells.
- This will allow to better characterize how gene expression is regulated and, ultimately, how cells translate a genotype into a phenotype.
