# Growth Adaptation to New Condition

[0. VU QSCB](Biology/VU%20Quantitative%20Single%20Cell%20Biology/0.%20VU%20QSCB.md)

- population level
- adjust to new nutrient level in the environment
- individual cells need to express novel genes to be able to restore growth in the new condition
- measure OD, mass to observe change in growth rate

## how does growth rate depend on constant environment condition

- ex. constant temperature
- keep condition constant, vary nutrient level (ex. glucose)
- during balanced growth, we know that the growth rate is constant and cell numbers increase exponentially with time $$
\frac{dN}{dt}=\mu N \Rightarrow N(t)=N(0)e^{\mu t}\Rightarrow\ln N(t)=\ln N(0)+\mu t
$$
- observation: growth rate depend hyperbolically on nutrient level (glucose level outside cell)
	- there is a maximum growth rate
	- hyperbolic relationship: glucose needs to be imported via a transporter. The permease follows enzyme kinetics. Enzyme kinetics gives the hyperbolic relationship.

## when conditions change, growth rate adapts

- grew E. Coli on glucose and sorbitol
- glucose is consumed first and then sorbitol
- The number of cells made during glucose growth is proportional to the added amount of glucose. This also happens during sorbitol growth.
- 3 experiments:
	- more sorbitol than glucose
	- same amount
	- more glucose than sorbitol
- Why does E. Coli grow first on glucose
	- Observed increased cell numbers as glucose level increases in the experiments
	- 3 times as much glucose lead to 3 times as many cells
- How do measure the growth rate
	- log transform the growth curve
	- will get a curve with 2 linear segments
	- slope of the linear segment for glucose is higher -> higher growth rate
- How do we know if sorbitol is not co-consumed with glucose, and glucose is not co-consumed with sorbitol
	- Use single carbon source
	- Compare growth rate to growth rate in combined carbon source
- Why can't the cells instantly switch to sorbitol growth?
	- need to _make the enzymes_ for sorbitol growth and remove glucose enzymes
- Why don't the cells express sorbitol genes when glucose is available?
	- It would waste energy and lead to lower growth rate on glucose
	- The strain that does this would be out-competed
- Model: a model that describes the curve and can be fitted to the data
	- glucose growth
	- nutrient depletion
	- sorbitol growth

## During changing conditions the growth rate is changing too

- Growth rate depends on time and the number of cells:
$$
\frac{dN}{dt}=\mu(t)N
$$
- Model: $$
\mu(t)=\mu(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{lag}}})\left( 1-\frac{N}{Y_{N/S}} \right)
$$
- This equation starts with a growth rate zero and reaches $\mu$ (provided enough nutrient is added) after an adaptation time
- Yield: $Y_{N /S}$
- First term: exponential growth
	- $e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{lag}}}$: goes to 0 as $t$ increases
- Second term: lag phase
