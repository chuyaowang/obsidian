## Fluorescence

- Excitation through a photon of a given length
- Emission of a photon at a typically higher wavelength (lower energy)

## Measurement

- Many different measurements are done at the same time for the same cell
- The same fluorescent protein can be excited by multiple wavelengths
- Forward scatter measurement
- Side scatter measurement
- Fluorescence measurement
- Measurements are deconvoluted into separate measurements

### Mechanism

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250606092842.png)

- Cells enter the column in single profile
	- 1000s of cells per second
- Report: peak intensity, peak area of _intensity vs. time_ peak
- Cell shape and size can change the signal - peak shape is orientation dependent

## Quality control

- Side scatter (SSC) vs. forward scatter (FSC): should have some correlation
- Histogram: counts of SSC for bins of FSC

## Examples

![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250606095554.png)

- X axis: fluorescence intensity
- histograms: counts
- Y axis: time
- As time goes after the stimulus, the population begins to produce fluorescent proteins

## Example: Sequential induction of metabolic pathway

- Growth on glucose: glycolysis + TCA cycle
- Growth on ethanol: gluconeogenesis + glyoxylate cycle
	- Enzymes: PCK1, ICL1
- Plotted the log fluorescence intensity of PCK1 vs. ICL1
- Population moves from low PCK, low ICL to high PCK, high ICL
- Note that the cells are only measured once. Then a new sample is measured for the next time point. Flow cytometry cannot take measurement of a cell in time.

## Example: cell cycle distributions

- [Cell Cycle](Biology/Concepts/Cell%20Cycle.md)
- Measures DNA fluorescence
- Amount of DNA fluorescence indicates cell cycle stage
- In cell division phases there is more DNA

## Flow cytometry summary

- Pros
	- Rapid
	- Large numbers of cells can be analyzed
	- Single cell information can be extracted
- Cons
	- Multiplexing not trivial
	- Individual cells are typically measured only once
	- Pseudotime instead of real time
	- Cells can get photo-bleached when they are exposed to too much light. Laser light can also cause photo-toxicity

## Extension of conventional flow cytometry

- Conventional flow cytometry:
	- Fluorescence-based (fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies)
	- Analysis and/or sorting
	- Two modalities: “single wavelength”/spectra
- Spectra flow cytometry
	- Measures full light spectrum
- Imaging flow cytometry:
	- Fluorescence-based
	- Only analysis
	- Digitalized images, quantitative microscopy
- Sorting (FACS)
	- Separate and collect a subpopulation of cells for further analysis
- Mass cytometry
	- Mass spectrometry-based (metal-conjugated antibodies)
	- Only analysis
	- High multiplexing capacity (up to 45 markers)
