## Single cell biology

### Definition

Single-cell biology is a field that studies biological processes at the level of individual cells, focusing on their unique characteristics and behaviors.  

It investigates how differences in cell states lead to distinct _cell fates_ within a population, contributing to our understanding of organisms' _development_, _diseases_, and other complex _biological phenomena_ emerging from the behavior of individual cells.

### Importance

- All life forms originate from a single cell
- A common ancestor: LUCA (last universal common ancestor)

### What fueled the advancement of single cell biology

- **Biomolecules** measured: Lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, proteins
- **Behaviors** measured: cell division, signaling in _time_
- **Key technologies**: fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, DNA/RNA sequencing, LCMS
- **Key discoveries**: 
	- isogenic cells (same genotype) are heterogeneous in nature (phenotype)
	- identify _cell states_ based on the molecular composition
	- elucidate how _cell states_ lead to distinct _cell fates_

## Gene expression noise
### How individual cells respond to environmental changes

- Changes in gene expression, metabolic state in response to environment
- **Gene expression noise**: variability in gene expression levels among isogenic cells in the same environment
- Landmark study (Elowitz et al. 2002): one of the first demonstrations of stochastic gene expression at the single cell level
	- Intrinsic noise
	- Extrinsic noise
- 2006-2010
	- Further studies in yeast and mammalian cells linked promoter architecture (e.g., presence of TATA boxes) to levels of expression noise
- 2010s onward: the rise of single-cell RNA sequencing, multi-omics and single-cell imaging (live and fixed) technologies enabled more precise quantification and modeling of gene expression noise in  various organisms and tissues.

#### Elowitz paper

- Transformed GFP and RFP into E. Coli. Identical promoters.
- Demonstrated cells with the same genome (i.e. isogenic) vary in their molecular content (RNA/proteins/lipids/metabolites) and size due to gene expression noise, even when exposed to the same environment

#### Intrinsic noise

- Definition: Variability in gene expression that arises from random fluctuations within a single cell.  
- Cause: Stochastic (random) events in processes like transcription and translation, such as:  
	- Binding/unbinding of transcription factors  
	- Ribosome binding  
- Effect: Even in identical environments, two copies of the same gene in the same cell can be expressed at different levels. 
- Example: In a single cell, one allele of a gene might be transcribed more frequently than the other due to random molecular interactions.

#### Extrinsic noise

- Definition: Variability in gene expression caused by differences between cells in factors that affect gene expression.  
- Cause: Cell-to-cell differences in:  
	- Number of ribosomes  
	- Concentration of RNA polymerase  
	- Cell size or stage in the cell cycle  
	- Environmental conditions  
- Effect: All genes in a cell might be expressed at higher or lower levels compared to another cell due to shared cellular conditions.  
- Example: Two cells might express the same gene differently because one has more transcription factors available.

### Why single cell

- Changes can affect only a subset of cells
- Bulk analysis average the change to the subset to the whole population

### Implications 

1. Cellular Diversity and Function
	- Noise enables _phenotypic diversity_ in a population of cells, even in uniform environments.
	- This diversity can be beneficial, such as in bacterial survival strategies (e.g., persister cells resisting antibiotics) or stem cell differentiation, where noise helps cells explore different fates.
2. Developmental Biology
	- During embryonic development, stochastic gene expression can influence _cell fate decisions_.
	- Noise can act as a mechanism for _symmetry breaking_, helping genetically identical cells adopt different roles.
3. Disease Mechanisms
	- In cancer, gene expression noise may contribute to _tumor heterogeneity_, _drug resistance_, and _metastasis_.
	- In autoimmune diseases, noise in immune cell gene expression might lead to _inappropriate activation_ or _tolerance failure_.
4. Drug Response and Resistance
	- Variability in gene expression can cause _differential drug sensitivity_ among cells, even within the same tumor or tissue.
	- This is a major challenge in _precision medicine_, where understanding noise can help predict and overcome _resistance_.
5. Synthetic Biology and Bioengineering
	- In engineered systems, noise can be either a bug or a feature: It can _disrupt predictable behavior_ in synthetic circuits.
	- Or it can be harnessed to create _stochastic switches_ or _bet-hedging strategies_ in engineered microbes.
6. Modeling and Systems Biology
	- Noise challenges traditional _deterministic models_ of gene regulation.  
	- It has led to the development of _stochastic models_ and _probabilistic frameworks_ in systems biology.

## Development of single cell biology

- **Sequencing Innovations** (2010): Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enabled gene expression analysis at the individual cell level, revealing rare and dynamic cell states. 
- **Microfluidics & Cell Isolation**: Droplet-based systems allowed efficient, large-scale processing of individual cells, making studies more scalable and affordable.
- **Computational Tools**: Advanced bioinformatics tools now manage and interpret complex single-cell data, enhancing our understanding of tissue heterogeneity.  
- **Multi-omics Integration**: Combining transcriptomics with epigenomic, proteomic, and spatial data offers a holistic view of cellular diversity.  
- **Biomedical Applications**: Single-cell techniques have revolutionized research in cancer, immunology, neurobiology, and development by identifying disease-specific cell states.  
- **Collaborative Ecosystem**:  The field has benefited from interdisciplinary collaboration between biologists, engineers, and data scientists, as well as funding from major research institutions and funding bodies.

> Progress in science depends on new techniques, new discoveries and new ideas, probably in that order.

### What can be achieved

- Cell mixture -> mRNA barcoding -> sequencing
- Additional modalities: genetic variants, epigenetics, proteins, spatial localization
- Identification of cell states
- Characterization of cell fates
- Single cell tracking and lineage tracing across generations

### Limitation in use

- Cost: 1 sample $3270, $2287 each for additional ones
- Cell range per sample: 1,000 - 10,000+ cells
- Factors influencing cell number:
	- Biological sample size and complexity
	- Desired resolution (e.g., rare cell types require more cells)
	- Budget constraints
	- Sequencing depth per cell (more depth = fewer cells for same cost)

| Tissue type | Estimated cells per cm${}^3$        |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Blood       | ~5 billion (mostly red blood cells) |
| Liver       | ~1 - 2 billion                      |
| Brain       | ~100 million - 1 billion            |
| Muscle      | ~1 billion                          |
| Fat         | ~100-300 million                    |

- How do single cell influence the behavior of a system?
- How can we infer the rules and properties of cell-to-cell interactions from single cell data to understand multicellular structures organization?
- What kind of computational approaches do we need to integrate the different data modalities?
- What new questions can be investigated by combining single-cell approaches with new microscopy, imaging and deep learning tools?

## Course objective

- Understanding of data collection
- Single cell data analysis
- Report
- Central question: given a changing environment, how can microorganisms grow optimally?

### Yeast

- Organisms that are very well-adapted to a specific niche environment (e.g. glucose containing media) have a fitness advantage when that environment is stable.
- However, being well-adapted to one environment can come at a fitness cost when the environment is changing.
- S. cerevisiae evolved so-called “bet-hedging” strategies, where organisms maintain a sub-optimal fitness in their typical conditions in exchange for increased fitness in anomalous or stressful conditions.
	- Heterogeneous response to a stimulus by an isogenic population is part of bet-hedging strategies in unicellular organisms -> at least some part of the population will have a growth advantage in unpredictable environments
- Another strategy that many organisms have developed is the capacity to deal with potentially recurring environmental fluctuations through **adaptive memory**.
	- Adaptation to environmental cues occurs via a range of mechanisms, including transcriptional regulation. This  “transcriptional memory” of a previous exposure to an environmental stimulus can be present as changes in gene expression that persist long after the inducing stimulus is no longer present or manifest as changes in the rate or strength of gene expression during a subsequent induction.
