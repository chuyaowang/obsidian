## Concepts

- Isogenic population: all cells have the same DNA
	- limited in a certain amount of time. In infinite time some variant will dominate other less fit variants
	- number of genes of yeast: 6,000
	- minimal fraction to make a copy:
		- glycolysis: ~14 genes
		- biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, DNA, energy: ~250
- phenotypic heterogeneity
	- no one-to-one mapping between the genotype and phenotype
	- genotype sets the _average_ phenotype, but not the phenotype of each cell
		- if a mutation is made, it would shift the average phenotype
	- about 20 years ago: isogenic cell behave differently in the same environment
- noise
	- why in the [Elowitz paper](Biology/VU%20Quantitative%20Single%20Cell%20Biology/1.%20VU%20QSCB%20Introduction.md#Elowitz%20paper), some cells express green, some express red, some are yellow (both green and red)?

## Fluorescence microscope

- GFP transformed E. Coli grown on agar pads
- Detect and visualize fluorescence emitted by GFP
- E. Coli. doubles mass then divide -> doubles then divide

### Growth not in sync

- Same beginning point, different cell size at a time point
- Cells in the center grow a little slower than those on the edge

### Cells with the same size do not have same greenness

- Lineage history
- More green cell comes from more green parent
- Parent cell makes more green proteins and give 50% of it to the child. The child contributes to the remaining 50% of its greenness.
- Yeast growth: not even division. The child is smaller than the parent.
	- hypothesis: to make more offsprings using the same amount of nutrient

## smRNA FISH

- magenta: mRNA 1
- yellow dots: mRNA 2
- blue dots: DNA
- amount of mRNA varies a lot
- mRNAs are synthesized and degraded at a fast rate (30 minutes)

## Noise

- Deviation from the mean
- Higher deviation - more noisy
- There is noise in mRNA level in a cell
- Noise in mRNA has a large influence on protein synthesis.
	- 20 mRNA leads to thousands of proteins
	- 1 more mRNA is a 5% change, but 1 more protein is a negligible change
- Transcription is also controlled in different ways: more stable over time vs. a burst of transcription
- Does natural selection increase or decrease noise?
- In a constant environment, cells become more similar to the phenotype that survives well in the environment - evolutionarily purifying selection
- In a dynamic environment, cells become more different to maximize adaptation - **bet hedging**

## Protein simulation in a cell

- Very crowded environment
- For proteins to move, it needs to collide and push away others
- Cannot predict the exact of a protein, only an average over time

### Thought experiment

- Two identical copies of cells. Let both live for some time. Do both copies end up in the exactly same state?
- Laplace's demon: Laplace's Demon is a thought experiment, formulated by Pierre-Simon Laplace, that imagines a being with immense intelligence and computing power.Â This being, if it existed, could know the exact position and velocity of every particle in the universe at a given moment and, using Newton's laws of motion, calculate the future and past with perfect accuracy.
- Not the same because the environmental molecules are different. If the environment is also kept exactly the same, the cells then would be in the same state.

### Diffusion as random walk

- In many simulations, the average head to tail distance of the trajectory distance would emerge
- $$
D=\frac{kT}{6\pi\eta a}
$$, k = Boltzmann coefficient, T = temperature in Kelvin, $\eta$ = viscosity, a = radius
- Bottom: viscosity represent interaction with other molecules in the environment.
- Proteins have on average the same $D$ but individual trajectories are very different.

## Lineage tracking

- y axis: time
	- cells do not divide at the same time because of difference in growth rate
- cells become more and more dissimilar as variation adds up
- how molecules are partitioned also depends on chance - not perfectly even divisions
