## Raffinose metabolism

- Raffinose structure
- Sucrose structure
	- metabolized by Suc2, cuts between fructose and glucose; have a low level of fructose.
	- Suc2 is substrate promiscuous: both raffinose and sucrose

## Biological computation

## What is growth

- Bacteria grow to increase population size
- Yeast grow non-symmetrically

## Measure growth

- Scattering
- Higher cell size and/or larger cell size scatter more light
- 48-well microtiter plate

### Growth curve

- log2 of OD on y axis, time on x axis

1. The lag phase (a through c). The duration of the lag phase depends, among other things, on the stage of the inoculated yeast and the composition and temperature of the old and new media.
2. The log phase, or exponential phase (c to d). Cells undergo regular growth at a constant specific growth rate.
3. The transitional phase (d to e). New adaptation phase.
4. The stationary phase (e to f). No further cell division takes place and also no cell lysis.
5. The death phase (f through h). Cell lysis will start. This will cause the level of turbidity (OD) to decrease.

### Growth curves are averages

- Average of different cell populations (ex. under glucose and galactose metabolism) in the culture

### Processing

- Smooth
- Log transform
- Identify maximum growth rate by taking the derivative
- Fit a straight line in the linear region

## Take home

- Different measurement techniques come with different pros and cons.  
	- Single cell approaches provide a much higher resolution, but are challenging and time consuming to implement, and throughput is often low.  
	- Population measurements are easier to implement, with a high throughput, but can obscure important single-cell phenomena. They are still very useful.
