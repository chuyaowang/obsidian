# meeting with lab

- **mRNA localization imaging**
- [c-Fos](C_Albicans%20Thesis%20Project/6.%20References/c-Fos%20as%20a%20transcription%20factor.md): stress biomarker, expressed following invasion
- spatial cFOS
- designing other probes with Stellaris probe designer
	- avoid aspecific binding
- research question?

---

- **MS2 system: mRNA imaging in live cells**
- genetically edit the strain, insert the tag, tag translates to loop, FP binds to the loop (MS2 system in lecture)
- if tag influences growth

---

- **quantification and analysis of hyphae**
- segmentation: identify each cell
	- problem: overlapping cells
	- use time series information?
	- why segmentation?
- branches: track branches that merge
	- recognize juncture points

---

- **label free microscope imaging strategy**
- FOV (field of vision) stitching to increase FOV
- what can the microscopy be used for?
- MS2 FISH
