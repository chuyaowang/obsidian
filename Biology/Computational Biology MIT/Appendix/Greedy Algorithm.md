## Overview

Greedy algorithms are optimization algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step to find a globally optimal solution.

It has a small time complexity. However, it may not always lead to the best solution.

## Creating a Greedy Algorithm

1. Define the problem: define the problem and the objective to be optimized
2. Identify the greedy choice: determine the locally optimal choice at each step based on the current state
3. Make the greedy choice: select the greedy choice and update the current state
4. Repeat: continue making greedy choices until a solution is reached.

## Examples
