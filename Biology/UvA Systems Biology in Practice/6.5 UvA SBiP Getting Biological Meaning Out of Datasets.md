# Getting Biological Meaning Out of Datasets

[0. UvA SBiP](Biology/UvA%20Systems%20Biology%20in%20Practice/0.%20UvA%20SBiP.md)

## Unboxing the blackboxes

- Sample -> MS -> Spectral data analysis -> Statistics -> Results

## Knowledge based data analysis

- Reading papers, searching pubmed
- Enrichment: gene ontology, KEGG, structure components
- Network analysis
- Pathway analysis

## Example

### What do we have

- Significantly altered proteins: 1704 proteins
- Their expression data
- Their p values

### What do we want

- Construct networks
	- edge: pathway, regulation relationship
- Enrichment

## General workflow in data analysis


## Gene ontology

- a hierarchical network about what genes and proteins do and where they are
- hierarchy: from grand processes to small processes
	- $A$ is a $B$, $B$ is a part of $C$. Then $A$ is a part of $C$
- Database contains
	- Molecular function: what reaction does it do
	- Cellular component: where they are in the cell
	- Biological process: biological role
- Enrichment: using a subset of genes/proteins; 
	- how do the GO terms linked to this subset compare to the terms of the entire database; 
	- how does the number of terms mapped compared to terms mapped by pure chance? -> p value
- Input: a list of significantly altered proteins
	- Background: the entire genome (default) or all the proteins detected
- Output: Over and/or overrepresented GO terms

### Over representation is calculated as


## GSEA

- Knowledge based
- Predefined gene sets
- Compare your gene sets to the predefined set and look for correlation
- Tools to prune the gene set list
	- semantic similarity filtering

## String db

[STRING](http://version10.string-db.org/help/database/)

- Interaction networks
- Different edge types
- Publications
- GO
- KEGG
- Knowledge based: unknown connection is not in the database; important to also look at disconnected nodes

## Metabolic pathway mapping

- static network
- mapping data to known metabolic reactions
- Cytoscape: give shape to network
	- sometimes manual drawing a network is also becessart
