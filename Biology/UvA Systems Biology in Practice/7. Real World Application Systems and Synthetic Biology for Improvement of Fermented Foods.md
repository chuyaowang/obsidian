# Systems and Synthetic Biology for Improvement of Fermented Foods

#seminar 


## Range of fermented foods

- Bacterial fermentation: acidification of products
	- yogurt
	- cheese
	- sausage
- Yeast: makes alcohol
	- also forms gas ($CO_{2}$)

### Fermentation

- Inputs
	- Sugar
	- Protein
- Outputs
	- ATP
	- Organic acids and ethanol
	- Amino acids
	- B Vitamins
	- Antibacterials
	- Flavours
	- Oils and fatty acids

## Improvement of food fermentation

- Growth: _Lactobacillus plantarum_, lactic acid, antifungal production
- Flavour production: Diacetyl production
- Oil production: increased production by pleasginous yeast
- Business case: technical economic analysis (TEA)

## Growth and preservation

- Bacterial species: _Lactobacillus plantarium_
	- Used for fermentation and as a natural preservative against fungi
- Example: use modeling approach to improve fermentation process
	- Problem: temporary growth delay but cannot identify cause
	- Observation:
		- Onset always after fixed fermentation time
		- Independent of $OD_{600}$ or pH
		- Only in aerobic culture

### Metabolic model L. plantarum

- Metabolic network: 772 genes > 651 reactions > 546 metabolites
- Look for mRNA that are more or less transcribed before and after growth delay happens
- Found genes related to $CO_{2}$ dependent reactions

### Hypothesis

- $CO_{2}$ flushes out > Growth arrest > $CO_{2}$ production turns on organism > Growth resumes
- Prediction: flushing in gas with $CO_{2}$ prevents growth delay
- Testing: it indeed restores growth

### Conclusion

- Redirecting metabolism for internal supply $CO_{2}$
- Complex fermentation problem solved:
	- Genome sequence  
	- Metabolic model  
	- Transcriptomics
	- Data-visualisation tool

### Relevance for current practice

- This species produces specific anti-fungal products
- These chemicals are now commonly used in food industry
- Also used for making protective cultures

## Flavor compound

- Diacetyl: butter flavor
	- Produced from co-fermentation of citrate in ppm (mg/kg)
	- Oxygen is needed for production
	- Produced using _Lactococcus lactis_

### _Lactococcus lactis_

- homolactic
- main product L-lactrate
- Central intermediate pyruvate
- -
- Pyruvate rerouting to produce more diacetyl

### Gene knock out to stop producing lactate

- Up to 75% conversion to acetoin
- Oxidation of acetoin to form diacetyl (oxygen presence needed)

### Metabolic model

- Simplified kinetic model
	- Relevant products only
	- Enzyme activities
	- Affinities for substrates

### Strategies to increase diacetyl production

- Control coefficient: higher means higher control, sign indicates positive or negative change
- NADH oxidase has the highest control coefficient
- Overexpression of NADH oxidase and knockout of acetoin producing enzyme

## Microbial oil and fatty acid

- _Cryptococcus curvatus_: accumulates oil under certain conditions
- Motivation:
	- Increased global population and livestock
	- Improved quality of food and feed: plant edible oils
	- Palm oils have led to high deforestation and $CO_{2}$
	- Production only in tropical climates
	- Microbial oil is more sustainable and can be produced in more places

### C. curvatus

- Major molecules in plant derived oils: 

### Platforms of producing tailor made microbial oil

- Optimization of lipid accumulation in C. oleaginosus and Y. lipolytics
	- Quantified carbon to nitrogen ratio on lipid production
- Influence of C.N ratio on lipid production
- Differential gene expression to find genes relevant for oil production
- Genes then used for metabolic engineering approach
	- A combination of 3 genes all related to fatty acid biosynthesis need to be up-regulated

## Cost model for support business case

- TEA
- Used for designing a chemical factory that is cost-effective
- Many parameters
	- Volume of fermentation: what volume needs to be done to be economically feasible; calculate price per kg oil produced
- Low CapEx: low equipment spending, less reactor control
- Currently: confirming the process at industrial scale: 100,000L+

## Summary

- Genome-scale mtabolic model, modeling
- SSB
- Dynamic mathematical modeling
- TEA
