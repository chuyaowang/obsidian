$$
\frac{\text{phosphate limited}}{\text{light limited}}
$$

low phosphate -> high transporter affinity
high phosphate -> thermodynamic drives phosphate in

transporter affinity and rate balance: high rate - low affinity, high affinity - low rate


NAs: not present in both groups, but may be detected in one of the groups
