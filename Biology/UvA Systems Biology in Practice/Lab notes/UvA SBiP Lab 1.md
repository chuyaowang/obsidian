## Order of operations

Ordered according to fastest to slowest change:
1. Transcription 
2. Proteomics 
3. OD

## Cell harvesting

- Use flame to avoid contamination when harvesting partial samples
- Different colors: pigment composition, number of cells
- Harvested 50 mL culture + cells
- Sterile operation: opening the cap with one hand and do not let it touch counter
- Fume hood: can contaminate the experiment as air is pulled in

## Project discussion

- Project: phosphate limitation and study ploidy 
- Hypothesis: more ploidy leads to faster adaptation 

### Cyanobacteria

- Circular chromosomes
- Ploidy
- Studies:
	- Isolated in 1960s
	- Photosynthesis
	- Circadian clock and gene expression coordination 
	- Cyanobacteria in water with over nutrition
	- Single cell variation of copy number within a population

## Cell sampling

- Sample for transcriptomics and proteomics
- 10 mL for proteomics
- 35 mL for transcriptomics

## Centrifuge:

- 4 degrees, 10 mins, 3000 G
	- G is consistent across centrifuges 
- Balance the weights inside the centrifuge
- Centrifuging stresses the cells, but still alive 

## OD measurement

- Pipette 80 microliter in cuvette
- Wavelengths:
	- 730 nm: cell number
	- 720 nm: cell number
	- 685 nm: chlorophyll A, photosystem 1
	- 634 nm: another light harvesting pigment, photosystem 2
	- 730 and 720 have low absorption for the pigments
- Start with a blank
- Align cuvette in the light direction
- OD measurement gives a rough estimate of cell number. Another machine can measure the exact cell number.
- Cell number can also be measured by dry weight, high error chance, require precise handling

## Metabolic engineering:

- Control the metabolic flux to maximize production of the desired products
- Random mutations and natural selection prefer growth rather than making of the product
- Strategy: control the network such that the production reaction is coupled to the growth reaction. No growth if no production
- Instability: the engineered production can stop working due to the high genetic instability of bacteria
- Technological advances are making some operations like gene knockouts faster
