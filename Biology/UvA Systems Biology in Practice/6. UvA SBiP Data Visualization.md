# Data Visualization

[0. UvA SBiP](Biology/UvA%20Systems%20Biology%20in%20Practice/0.%20UvA%20SBiP.md)

## Visualizing distribution of data

- Point plot
- Box plot or table of means and quantiles
- Violin plot
- Is the distribution normal: QQ plot

## Data transformation

- In metabolomics and proteomics, dynamic range is high. Some signal is extremely strong
- Scaling: putting features on the same scale
	- Z score
	- log transform
	- Necessary for PCA
- Median normalization: subtract median from data; goal is to make features the same median
	- should I do it: if they are from replicates, they should have about the same median

## Find correlation and regression

- Scatter plot: identify correlation and deviation
- Ratio plot
	- integration of data: proteomics expression go up, does transcriptomics go up or down
- Volcano plot

## Finding structure in data

### Heat map

- Structured heat map
- Visualize similar samples

### Clustering

- Clustering into groups
- Distances:
	- different choices
- Partition methods:
	- k means
	- k mediods
	- k modes
- Hierarchical methods
	- agglomerative
	- bottom up
- Molecular grouping does not necessarily match physical grouping (based on phenotype)

## Network analysis

- Dynamic network: built from the data
- Static network: ex. glycolysis; map the data onto the static network

### Starting with a gene list

- Build a network
- Use existing pathway network

### Pathways

- Metabolic
- Signaling
- Regulatory
- Disease
- Key distinction
	- pruned and --
	- --

### Dynamic network

- Non static
- Context dependent
- What is on the edge?
	- coexpression
	- interaction
	- up/down regulation
	- score of how alike MS2 spectra are: gives a molecular network based on similar fragmentation pattern, implied similar molecules
		- which set of nodes behave different between groups. They might belong to the same pathway
- Tends to become a furball

### Terminology

- Node
- Node degree
- Motif
- Modules or communities
- Hierarchy

### Analytical approaches

- Node degree
- Closeness centrality: how close to other nodes
- Betweenness centrality: how central it is in the total network
