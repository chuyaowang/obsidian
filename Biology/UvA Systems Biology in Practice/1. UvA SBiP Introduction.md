## Molecular microbial physiology

- Measurement of compounds
- Cyanobacteria
- Production of $C$ compounds
- Evolutionary strategy

## Background

### Definition of research theme

- how to organisms cope with different environments?
- [A single microbial species can catalyze different macro-chemical reactions and has select one](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/13.%20VU%20BMBN%20Phenomenological%20Models%20for%20Ecology%20and%20Cell%20Biology.md#A%20single%20microbial%20species%20can%20catalyze%20different%20macro-chemical%20reactions%20and%20has%20select%20one)
- The organism senses the signal and responds to it

### Cyanobacteria

- little green bugs
- photosynthetic
- PCC6803, a model cyanobacteria
	- relatively fast growth rate
	- genome sequenced in 1997
	- many tools for metabolic engineering
	- [Genome Scaled Metabolic Model](LCMS/Genome%20Scaled%20Metabolic%20Model.md)
	- growth models

### Ploidy

- Number of complete sets of chromosomes per cell
- Eukaryotes: poly, oligo, and diploidy is very common
- Prokaryotes:
	- Mero-oligoploidy: fill in from slide
- Synechocystis ploidy
	- Easy to make a mistake in counting ploidy
- Why have ploidy?
- Why is polyploidy conserved?
	- More exploration of the sequence landscape because there are multiple copies and backups
	- Storage: storing phosphate and store them in the DNA
	- Resistance to desiccation (drought)
- Is ploidy level regulated?
	- Cell cycle signaling?
	- DNA replication control? Does it cost energy to limit or promote DNA replication
- Can we use ploidy to speed up segregation?
	- A mutation happens and it changes its offspring
	- When there is ploidy, so 1 out of 20 copies is affected
	- How does this affect segregation?

## Experiment plan

- How does organism adapt to environment
- Why is ploidy regulated
- What parameters to vary
	- Phosphate concentration
	- growth rate
- What to measure
	- phosphate
	- ploidy
	- omics
- Reality check
	- how much sample volume is needed
	- how much time does it take
	- antibiotics are dissolved in ethanol. Ethanol can change the cell behavior but it appears like antibiotics did.
	- special equipment needed
	- what is the cost
- Data
	- low phosphate (~0.0115 mM)
	- normal phosphate (~0.23 mM)
	- low phosphate limits growth
- Determine ploidy level
- Internal machinery
- Parameter to control
	- Phosphate conc
	- Nutrient conc
	- Light availability
	- Biomass concentration
	- Growth rate
- Turbidostat
	- Biomass is monitored to be kept constant
	- Monitor optical density
	- When biomass accumulates
		- Dilute (add fresh medium)
		- Remove cells
- Comparing conditions
	- light controls the growth rate
	- phosphate limited and light limited
- How to measure ploidy
	- Spectroscopy
	- Fluorescence spectroscopy
	- FACS
	- qPCR
- qPCR
	- Count and break cells
	- Amplify specific fragment using primers and DNA polymerase
	- Measure fluorescence of newly synthesized double stranded DNA fragments
	- Calculate amount of DNA fragments per cell
	- how many cycles of PCR does it take to achieve a fluorescence level: the more copies there are, the faster it is
- The multi-cultivator
- Exp
	- 4 phosphate limited, 4 light limited
	- 3 replicates

## Data analysis

- 7 processed datasets
- example figures are provided
- bring the analysis further or show different aspects of the data

### Microbial physiology data

- pigment composition: should change in different light conditions, a sanity check
- growth rate
	- 730 nm so peak does not fall over pigment peaks
- ploidy
