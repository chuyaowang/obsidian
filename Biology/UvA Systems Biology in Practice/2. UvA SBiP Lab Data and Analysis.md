## CASY counter

[CASY Counter](Biology/UvA%20Systems%20Biology%20in%20Practice/CASY%20Counter.md): how it works
### Protocol

1. Dilute sample of interest (measurement range)
2. Pipette 10 $\mu L$ sample into CASY vial with 10 $mL$ of CASY-ton buffer (a phosphate buffer to provide electric field)
3. Insert CASY vial into CASY counter
4. Measure:
	1. 3 technical repeats per measurement. Must all succeed
	2. Each repeat takes 200 $\mu L$ from the vial
	3. The machine reports:
		1. Total number of counts: total number of cells
		2. Peak diameter: majority cell size
		3. Average diameter: average cell size

> Using these results, the $\frac{\#cells}{mL}$ can be calculated after _dilution_ is accounted for

## Polymerase chain reaction

- Make many more DNA strands from 1 DNA strand
- Steps:
	- **Denaturation** of double stranded DNA
	- **Annealing** of primer
	- **Elongation** of the new DNA strand from the primers
	- This completes one **cycle**, and the next cycle continues

### Real time PCR (qPCR)

[qPCR](Biology/UvA%20Systems%20Biology%20in%20Practice/qPCR.md): how it works

- Add a fluorescent dye to synthesized double strand DNA to track the progression of PCR reaction. This allows 
- In which cycle do I detect fluorescence?: more copies to begin with, fewer cycles
- Quantifying DNA: cycle threshold
- Standard: known concentration of DNA
- Background correction: correct for differences among wells in initial (dye)
- qPCR can be used to determine the expression rate of different genes
- Amplification efficiency (E):
	- cannot be ontained ffrom standard curve
	- depends on how well the primer is designed
- Unspecific amplification
- No template control
- Melting curve

## Ploidy determination

BBB
ABB for ploidy determination
MT not needed

gram to mol and mol to gram. Use mol for calculation

formula:
$$
[DNA]\left( \frac{\text{\#molecules}}{\mu L} \right)=
$$
- the sequence of something is atg, for example, how to calculate the molecular weight?
	- tools online to calculate molecular weight. Loss of H in the chain but not at the ends.
	- Account for double or single strand


 $\frac{mL}{\text{cells}}\times \frac{\text{\# molecules}}{\mu L}\times \frac{10^3 \mu L}{1 mL}$
