# CASY Counter

The CASY counter is an advanced cell counting and analysis system that uses electrical current exclusion and pulse area analysis to measure cell size, viability, and concentration. Here's how it works:

1. **Principle of Operation**:
   - Cells are suspended in a specialized buffer and pass through a precision measuring pore between two electrodes.
   - As each cell passes through the pore, it generates an electrical pulse. The intensity of the pulse correlates with the cell's volume.

2. **Cell Viability Assessment**:
   - Viable cells have intact membranes that act as insulators, preventing the electric current from passing through.
   - Dead cells, with compromised membranes, allow the current to pass through, and their smaller nuclear volume is detected.

3. **Aggregation Correction**:
   - The system can detect and correct for cell aggregation by calculating how many single cells fit within each aggregate.

4. **Data Analysis**:
   - CASY provides detailed cell size distribution profiles, which can reveal information about cell homogeneity, aggregation levels, and potential contamination.

5. **Advantages**:
   - It eliminates the need for viability dyes like Trypan Blue.
   - Offers high precision and reproducibility, with a variation below Â±2%.
   - Compatible with various cell types, including bacteria, yeast, and stem cells.

The CASY counter is widely used in research and quality control environments for its accuracy and efficiency. You can find more details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASY_cell_counting_technology) or [here](https://www.ols-bio.com/casy-s-technology).
