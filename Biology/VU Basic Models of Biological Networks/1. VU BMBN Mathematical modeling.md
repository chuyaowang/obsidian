## Models

- description of nature
- a model is a hypothesis
- integrates knowledge
- mechanistic, causal, but not always
	- summation of existing features of the world
	- abstraction at some level
- may have a purpose

## Complexities in nature

- **Static** patterns exist in nature, simple mechanisms underly them; models describe the patterns
	- sand dunes
	- patterns on shells
- **Dynamic** patterns, simple mechanisms, **physicochemical systems**
	- Belousov-Zhabotinski reaction: waves of chemicals form because of chemical reactions
	- Rayleigh-Benard convection: pattern formation in water film exposed to temperature gradient
		- the cells are created by heat transferring from the bottom to the top then top to the bottom
- **Dynamic** patterns, simple mechanisms, formed by a **collection of agents**
	- flocks of starling bird
	- ants making a bridge
	- a school of fish
- **Static** patterns, formed by **unknown mechanisms**
	- regular patterns in plants, not encoded in DNA
	- self-replicating patterns in computer-generated fern leaves
- **Dynamic** patterns, **complex mechanisms**
	- C. elegans worm development
		- when two cell populations mix, their NADH oscillations begin to synchronize
	- Oscillating yeast cells
	- Modeling: model for each cell, then couple the models
- Mathematics and complexity - fractals, Mandelbroth set
- Models may generate the same pattern but is not the same as the underlying mechanism
	- they describe the pattern but does not connect to the underlying mechanism

### Abstraction

- choosing what level of complexity to focus and what to ignore
- example: computer-generated Jackson Pollock's paintings
	- his paintings are done in a certain predictable way
- recipes, models, and algorithms are analogous:
	- recipe: ingredients $\rightarrow$ dish
	- sin function: $x \rightarrow \sin(x)$
	- algorithm: model, $x(t) \rightarrow x(t+\Delta x)$

### Nature and complexity

- complex behavior emerges from interactions
	- how fish or birds interact
- pattern formation
- self-organization
- underlying mechanisms vary from simple to complex

## How is nature organized for such complexity to arise

- Nested hierarchy
	- atom, molecule, cell organelles, cell, tissue, ..., ecosystem, bioma
- Systems vary in complexity
	- a rock vs. a fruit fly
	- a fly is more complex, can adapt
	- one does not make a model of the full fly, but only parts of it to understand it; a model cannot adapt like a real fruit fly
- Complexity emerges from _interactions_ between the lower level constituents of systems

## Why do we make models
  
- to forecast; to make predictions  
- to engineer new technologies and medicine  
- to understand the principles of nature  
- ....

### Models in science and engineering

- Computational fluid dynamics in mechanics engineering
- Computational fluid dynamics for weather forecasting, ocean currents, temperature distribution on earth
- Protein structure models, models of organs for medicine
- Metabolic networks models for metabolic engineering
- Neural networks such as AlphaFold and ChatGPT
	- Traditional models
		- set of equations: from physical laws, chemical element constraints, etc.
		- parameters
		- Given current state at time t $\rightarrow$ future state at $t+\Delta t$
		- Need equations first
	- [The Universal Approximation Theorem](The%20Universal%20Approximation%20Theorem.md): with enough data, neural networks can model without equations
	- Biology is data poor
		- expensive to acquire
		- varying data generation standards make data integration difficult
- Cell biology, biochemistry, and drug target identification

## Different types of models

- Equation based models
	- causal mechanistic models of systems 
		- given the properties of the parts of a system  
	- phenomenological models 
		- The ideal gas law: $PV=nRT$; describe the phenomenon but not the mechanism
		- given a crude description of a phenomenon generated by a system  
	- empirical models
		- given data
- “Equation-free” models
	- neural networks (can approximate any mathematical equation)
		- heavily reliant on the existence of the right set and sufficient data (still rare)

### Example: cell cycle

- Biological process: the cell cycle
- proposed molecular mechanism
- outcome of mechanistic model
- check if observation agrees with the outcome

### Different simulation formalisms of models

- **Deterministic** model
	- as function of time
	- as function of time and space
- **Non-deterministic** (stochastic) models
	- as function of time
	- as function of time and space
- used in many fields: biology, engineering, physics, sociology, oceanography
- the mathematics and modeling formalisms are discipline independent

### Reduction and explanation

 - Explainability of models
 - Interpretable AI: explain the equation-free neural networks

### Molecular complexity and a need for simplification

- genetic networks
- metabolic networks
- signalling

### Hypothesis driven research in systems biology

- Selection of contradictory issues of biological significance
- Creation of a model representing the phenomenon
	- Automatically
	- Manually
	- Represents a computable sets of assumptions and hypotheses that needs to be tested or supported experimentally
- Perform computational (_dry_) experiments to test the adequacies of the models
	- Inadequate models expose inconsistencies with established facts, and need to be rejected or modified
- Models that are adequate become subjects of a thorough system analysis where a number of _predictions_ may be made
- A set of predictions that can distinguish a correct model among competing models is selected for _wet_ experiments
- Successful experiments are those that eliminate inadequate models.
- Models that survive this cycle are deemed to be consistent with existing experimental evidence.

 > "Order and Chaos in Pollock’s Art" by Richard P. Taylor

### Important Concepts

1. **Jackson Pollock's Technique**:
   - Pollock's unique technique involved dripping and swirling paint on horizontal canvases, creating continuous trajectories and patterns.
   - This method polarized the art world, with debates on whether it was raw genius or mere drunken chaos.

2. **Fractals in Nature and Art**:
   - Taylor drew parallels between Pollock's patterns and natural fractals, which are intricate, self-similar patterns found in nature.
   - Fractal geometry, developed by Benoit Mandelbrot, describes these patterns and their dimensions.

3. **Fractal Dimension (D)**:
   - The fractal dimension quantifies the complexity of patterns, with values between 1 (simple line) and 2 (filled area).
   - Pollock's paintings exhibited fractal dimensions, suggesting a deep, inherent order within his seemingly chaotic work.

4. **Computer Analysis**:
   - Taylor used computer analysis to quantify the fractal nature of Pollock's paintings, revealing their fractal characteristics over a wide range of scales.
   - This analysis demonstrated that Pollock was painting fractals long before their scientific discovery.

5. **Aesthetic Appeal of Fractals**:
   - Research indicated that people have a preference for fractal patterns with certain dimensions, contributing to the visual appeal of Pollock's art.
   - Pollock's paintings evolved to display higher fractal dimensions over time, engaging viewers more actively.

6. **Implications for Art Authentication**:
   - The presence of fractal patterns in Pollock's work offers a potential method for authenticating his paintings.
   - Computer analysis of fractals can distinguish between genuine Pollock paintings and imitations.

### Author's Insights

- Taylor posits that Pollock's art was not just random but was deeply connected to natural rhythms and patterns.
- The systematic, deliberate process Pollock used to create his paintings reflects an intrinsic order that resonates with fractal geometry.
- The appeal of Pollock's work may be rooted in the fractal nature of his patterns, tapping into a universal preference for certain complexities.
