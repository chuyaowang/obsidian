## Models of complex and higher level systems

- Nature systems, such as a human or a bacterial colony, comprise of many cells
- Instead of modeling individual cells, another approach is to model their interactions and their nutrient input rate and product output rate
- A net model of microbial physiology
- Likewise we may model interactions between neurons, organs, ecosystems using net models of their components
- Phenomenological models: modeling without understanding of the mechanisms

## Degradation of plant biomass

- Fungi and bacteria degrade plant biomass to grow themselves
- lignocellulose $\rightarrow$ biomass + butyrate + methane + carbon dioxide
- The community consists of multiple different species. They have a total biomass.
- Question:
	- How does a species interact with the environment
	- Why is a species more abundant than others

### Modeling the production of methane and carbon dioxide production

- Do we want a dynamic model?
	- model the abundances of microbes and concentration of the nutrients they cross feed?
- Do we want a steady state model for estimated averaged emissions over a year?
- What do we want to learn?

### Step 1: determine genomes of the involved strains and infer their metabolic network

- Sample
- Meta-genome sequencing
- Reconstruct species genomes
- Reconstruct metabolic network
- Make network computable: chemical element balancing, stoichiometric matrix
- Stoichiometric network computation

### Step 2: Infer net models of metabolic stoichiometry in terms of substrates products and biomasses

- Challenge: compute from a genome scale stoichiometric metabolic network reconstruction of a microbial all the growth media it can grow on. ie. niche enumeration
	- From the genome, determine nutrient sets we expect they can grow
	- A macro-chemical equation: the stoichiometry of a reaction catalyzed by a cell (instead of single enzyme)

## Dynamic models

- We desire now a rate equation associated with a macro-chemical reaction
- the equation models the steady state growth rate of a cell as function of external nutrient, product, and effector concentrations (similarly to enzyme kinetics)

$$
\sum_{\text{nutrient}}\text{stoichiometric coefficients}\times \text{nutrients} \overset{\text{growth rate}}\rightarrow \text{1 gram biomass} + \sum_{\text{products}}\text{stoichiometric coefficients}\times \text{product}
$$

- from [10. VU BMBN A Self Regulating Metabolism Model](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/10.%20VU%20BMBN%20A%20Self%20Regulating%20Metabolism%20Model.md) we found for the galactose model that the steady state uptake is hyperbolic (steady state metabolic flux vs $gal_e$) ![[Media/10. VU BMBN A Self Regulating Metabolism Model 2025-03-19 10.20.38.excalidraw]]
- This constitutes the net model: describe the relation between growth rate and nutrient as a hyperbolic curve

### Rate equation for macro-chemical equation can be derived

- similar to enzyme kinetic equation in form
- NG: non-growth protein
- g: growth
- fast growing cells are not very tolerant because all their proteins are used for growth

- Examples
Single substrate limiting:
$$g = \left( 1 - \frac{e_{NG}}{e_T} \right) g_{max} \frac{s}{D + s} = g^{Monod}_{max} \frac{s}{K^{\text{Monod}}_S + s}$$

Two substrates limiting:
$$g = \left( 1 - \frac{e_{NG}}{e_T} \right) g_{max} \frac{\frac{s_1s_2}{K_1K_2}}{\frac{s_1s_2}{K_1K_2} D + \frac{s_1}{K_1} + \frac{s_2}{K_2}}$$

Three substrates limiting:

$$g = \left( 1 - \frac{e_{NG}}{e_T} \right) g_{max} \frac{\frac{s_1 s_2 s_3}{K_1 K_2 K_3}}{D + \frac{s_1 s_2}{K_1 K_2} + \frac{s_1 s_3}{K_1 K_3} + \frac{s_2 s_3}{K_2 K_3}} $$

### A single microbial species can catalyze different macro-chemical reactions and has select one

- It choose between them which one to prioritize
- Fitness postulate: it changes gene expression at each moment in time in the direction of the macro-chemical reaction supporting the highest growth rate
- When a species chooses to do one macro-chemical reaction, its product is used by other species. Their macro-chemical reaction then changes the nutrient environment, which affects the species in the beginning.
- How can we model this? 

Problem description:

- Macro-chemical reaction $i$: has resource function $\phi_{i}$, and $\sum \phi_{i}=1$ fixed resource
- has a growth rate given by its rate equation, $g_{i}$
- **puzzle 1**: what is the growth rate of the cell?
	- the growth rate of the cell is the _weighted average_ of the growth rate of all the macro-chemical reactions: $$g=\sum_{i}\phi_{i}g_{i}$$
	- $g_{i}$ is  $$g_{i}=\left( 1-\frac{e_{NG}}{e_{T}}\right)g_{max} \frac{\frac{S_{1}S_{2}}{K_{1}K_{2}}}{D \frac{S_{1}S_{2}}{K_{1}K_{2}}+\frac{S_{1}}{K_{1}}+\frac{S_{2}}{K_{2}}}$$
	- growth rate weighted by resource available described by the resource function
	- $g_{i}$ can be _greater_ than $g$: it can have a high growth rate but no resource is allocated
- **puzzle 2**: how to express mathematically the allocation of resources to the faster growing macro-chemical reaction?
	- As cell adapts, it tries to increase the total growth rate $g$
	- $\phi$ represents resource allocation. Its change in time is $\frac{d\phi}{dt}$
	- $\frac{d\phi_{i}}{dt}=\phi_{i}(g_{i}-g)$
	- $0=\sum_{i} \frac{d\phi}{dt}=\sum_{i}\phi_{i}g_{i}-\sum_{i}\phi_{i}g_{i}=g-g\overbrace{ \sum_{i}\phi_{i} }^{ 1 }=0$: total resource change sums to 0
- **puzzle 3**: how to update the allocation of resources?
	- growth rate needs to be adjusted fast enough -> regulation required
		- add a regulatory term to $g_{i}$, proportional to $\frac{1}{\phi_{i}}$; if the performance increase is large and resource is allocated low, the regulatory term is strong.
		- $$g_{i}=\left( 1-\frac{e_{NG}}{e_{T}}\right)g_{max} \frac{\frac{S_{1}S_{2}}{K_{1}K_{2}}}{D \frac{S_{1}S_{2}}{K_{1}K_{2}}+\frac{S_{1}}{K_{1}}+\frac{S_{2}}{K_{2}}}+\frac{1}{\phi_{i}}(\text{performance increase})$$
	- X: biomass/abundance of the species
		- $$\frac{dx}{dt}=gX-dX=\sum_{i}\phi_{i}g_{i}X$$
		- $g$ is growth rate and $d$ is death rate; for simplicity, death rate is ignored
	- For all nutrient $s_{j}$, ignoring flow in and flow out for simplicity
		- $$\begin{aligned}\frac{ds}{dt}&=\text{produced - consumed + flow in - flow out}\\&=-\sum_{i}g_{s_{ij}}^-X_{i}+\sum_{i}X_{i}g^+_{s_{ij}}\end{aligned}$$

## Gut microbiome

- We need to consider: in addition to microbes switching metabolisms
	- spatial organization of the colon: nutrient on top, waste at the bottom
	- gradient of nutrients along the length of the colon as a result of microbial activity
	- microbial species will settle where their favorite nutrients are and whether they can sustain a growth rate that equals the net flow rate of material through the colon
	- loss of microbes in feces
- Need a spatial model
