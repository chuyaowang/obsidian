## Enzyme kinetics for 2 substrates and 2 products

![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-21 15.07.55.excalidraw]]
- $A+B\leftrightharpoons P+Q$
- See [Binding polynomial for 2 substrates and 2 products](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Binding%20polynomial%20for%202%20substrates%20and%202%20products) for 3 situations of state transition diagrams and binding polynomials
- $$v=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}-V_{M}^- \frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}}{1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}}$$
	- This assumes independent binding of products and substrates, but products and substrates do not bind at the same time 
- Binding polynomial: 
	- depicts the binding of reactants and effectors to the enzyme. Binding can occur in the _catalytic site_ or the _allosteric site_. The allosteric site influences the catalytic site from a distance.
	- when the bindings are independent, it can be factored into catalytic site contribution and allosteric site contribution. See [Situation 1](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Situation%201).

## Enzyme effector

![[Media/6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding 2025-03-25 15.37.30.excalidraw]]

- Effector: not converted by enzyme; binds and unbinds in the same state
- Monomeric enzyme can have
	- catalytic site: reactant and effector can bind
	- allosteric site(s): effector can bind
	- **competitive binding**: effector binding can prevent reactant binding at the catalytic site
	- **non-competitive binding**: effector binding to the allosteric site can activate or inhibit the function

## Derive enzyme kinetics for 3 different state transition diagrams

- $A = 1+\frac{a}{K_A}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}$ [Situation 3](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Situation%203)
- $B = 1+\frac{a}{K_A}+\frac{b}{K_B}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_AK_B}+\frac{p}{K_P}+\frac{q}{K_Q}+\frac{pq}{K_PK_Q}$ [Situation 2](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Situation%202)
- $C = 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot q}{K_{A}K_{Q}}+\frac{b\cdot p}{K_{B}K_{P}}=\left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)\left( 1+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}} \right)$ [Situation 1](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Situation%201)
- Their rate equation differ only in the denominator (the binding polynomial), not the numerator, since the same reaction is being catalyzed.
- Effector will add new terms to the binding polynomial (when at the activator site) or multiplied by another expression (when at the allosteric site)
- Every state in the [State transition diagram](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/2.%20VU%20BMBN%20State%20Transition%20Diagram.md#State%20transition%20diagram) has a term in the binding polynomial

### Case C

- The binding polynomial can be factored into 2 sites.
- Terms within each factor compete for binding
	- A and P compete for a binding site
	- B and Q compete for a binding site

![[Media/6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding 2025-03-25 15.49.25.excalidraw]]

### Another binding polynomial example

- Reaction: $A+B\leftrightharpoons P$
- This can happen via different mechanisms
	- $\mathcal{B}=\left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)\left( \frac{b}{K_{B}} \right)$
	- $\mathcal{B}=\left( 1+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)\left( \frac{a}{K_{A}} \right)$
	- $\mathcal{B}=1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}$
- Different ways to factorize a binding polynomial reflect different binding mechanisms
	- P competing with A
	- P competing with B
	- P competing with both A and B: no factorization; once P binds A and B cannot bind -> not independent binding

## Inhibitor effector binding in the catalytic site

![[Media/6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding 2025-03-25 15.54.41.excalidraw]]

- Binding at the catalytic site prevents binding of substrates or products.
- Binding polynomial: $$
\mathcal{B}=1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{i}{K_{I}}
$$
- The inhibitor term is added to the other terms for the catalytic site.

## Inhibitor binding at the allosteric site

![[Media/6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding 2025-03-25 15.58.31.excalidraw]]
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B}&=1+\frac{i}{K_{I}}+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{i\cdot a}{K_{I}K_{A}}+\frac{i\cdot p}{K_{I}K_{P}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot b\cdot i}{K_{A}K_{B}K_{I}}+\frac{i\cdot p\cdot q}{K_{I}K_{P}K_{Q}}\\
&=(1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}})(1+\frac{i}{K_{I}})\\
&=\mathcal{C}\times\mathcal{A}
\end{aligned}
$$

- Assumes binding at the catalytic site does not change $K_I$ for the allosteric site

## Activator binding at the allosteric site

![[Media/6. VU BMBN Enzyme kinetics 2025-02-20 14.19.27.excalidraw]]

- Binding of activator generally happens at the allosteric site. 
	- If it binds at the catalytic site and blocks the reactants, it would not be an activator
- Its binding changes the **conformation** of the enzyme and it becomes more active: change in reaction rate parameters
	- Before binding: $k^+,k^-$
	- After binding: $k'^+,k'^-$
- Deriving the rate equation for activator binding at the allosteric site (see steps in [Single substrate single product](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Single%20substrate%20single%20product)):

1. Write down the enzyme conservation: $$e_{T}=e+ea+ep+eab+epq+xe+xea+xeab+xep+xepq$$
2. Write down the rate equation: $$v=k^+eab+k'^+xeab-k^-epq-k'^-xepq$$
3. Write the enzyme-reactant complexes in terms of dissociation constants and concentrations: $$eab=\frac{e\cdot a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}},\quad xeab=\frac{x\cdot e \cdot a\cdot b}{K_{X}K_{A}K_{B}},\quad epq=\frac{e\cdot p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}},\quad xepq=\frac{x\cdot e\cdot p\cdot q}{K_{X}K_{P}K_{Q}}$$
4. Solve for $e$ from enzyme conservation: $$e=e_{T} \frac{1}{\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{C} }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{A} }}$$
	1. Since the binding is independent at the catalytic and the allosteric site, the binding polynomial can be factored.
5. Plug $e$ in the rate equation from step 2:  $$\begin{aligned}
v&=\frac{k^+e_{T} \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+k'^+e_{T} \frac{x\cdot a\cdot b}{K_{X}K_{A}K_{B}}-k^- \frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}-k'^- \frac{x\cdot p\cdot q}{K_{X}K_{P}K_{Q}}}{\left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right)\left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)}\\
&=\frac{k^+e_{T} \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}\left( 1+\frac{k'^+}{k^+} \frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)-k^-e_{T} \frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}\left( 1+ \frac{k'^-}{k^-} \frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)}{\left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right)\left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)}
\end{aligned}$$

### Conceptual interpretations of activator binding

- The binding polynomial is factored into a term for the catalytic site and a term for the allosteric site: $$\mathcal{B} = \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right)\left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)$$
	- At the allosteric site, the activator binds
	- At the catalytic site, $a$ and $p$ can bind. $b$ and $q$ cannot bind without $a$ and $p$ first binding. This is the same as before.
	- This gives an _easy way_ to write out complex binding polynomials
- $\left( 1+\frac{k'^+}{k^+} \frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)$ term in the numerator:
	- Continuing from [Conceptual interpretations of the binding polynomial](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Conceptual%20interpretations%20of%20the%20binding%20polynomial) and [Conceptual interpretation of rate equation](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Conceptual%20interpretation%20of%20rate%20equation)
	- This terms modifies the forward and backward reaction rate with 2 contributions
		- $1$ represents the contribution to reaction rate from the free enzyme $e$. The more free enzyme there is, the faster the reaction can happen.
			- If there is no activator present, the modification is 1. No scaling up or down happens.
		- $\frac{x}{K_{X}}$ represents contribution to reaction rate from the enzymes bound to the activator $ex$. The more activator bound enzyme there is, the faster the reaction can happen.
	- If $k'^+>k^+$, $\frac{k'^+}{k^+}>1$. An _activator_ is bound.
	- If $k'^+<k^+$, $\frac{k'^+}{k^+}<1$. An _inhibitor_ is bound. (In [Inhibitor binding at the allosteric site](#Inhibitor%20binding%20at%20the%20allosteric%20site), we did not assume conformational change after inhibitor binding)
	- If $k'^+=k^+$, $\frac{k'^+}{k^+}=1$. The binding at the allosteric site has no effect, and this term cancels with $\left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)$ in the binding polynomial. Its effect _disappears_ completely from the rate equation.
