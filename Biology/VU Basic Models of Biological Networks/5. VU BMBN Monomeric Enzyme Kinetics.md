## Net models of enzymes and regulatory proteins

- Net models are reduced from more complex models
	- Reduce the [State transition diagram](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/2.%20VU%20BMBN%20State%20Transition%20Diagram.md#State%20transition%20diagram) of galactose uptake to a single equation
	- Reduce multistep activation of a [Transcription Factor](Biology/Concepts/Transcription%20Factor.md) to a single process
- Net models can be made for **enzymes** involved in signaling and metabolism and for **regulatory proteins** involved in gene regulation and signaling.
	- Enzymes: this and [6. VU BMBN Enzyme Kinetics for Effector Binding](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/6.%20VU%20BMBN%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%20for%20Effector%20Binding.md), [7. VU BMBN Multimeric Enzyme Kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md), and [8. VU BMBN General Form of Multimeric Enzyme Kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/8.%20VU%20BMBN%20General%20Form%20of%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md)
	- Regulatory proteins: [8.5. VU BMBN Multimeric Regulatory Enzymes](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/8.5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Regulatory%20Enzymes.md)
- Net models are used to make larger models of molecular circuits.

## Enzymes

- Motor proteins
- Metabolic enzymes
- Extracellular enzymes
- Mutations in enzymes and regulatory proteins alter their function and the fitness of the organism. 
- The impact of mutations can be predicted from experiments and models of enzymes and regulatory proteins

### Cyclic enzyme mechanism

- Enzymes are catalysts - they are recycled after the completion of a reaction
- **All** net catalytic events are described by cyclic mechanisms: ![5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-02-19 23.42.31.excalidraw](Media/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%202025-02-19%2023.42.31.excalidraw.md)
	- Reaction: $E+S\leftrightharpoons ES \leftrightharpoons EP \leftrightharpoons E+P$
	- Enzymes begin and end in the same state.
- The **rate** can be described from _mass action kinetics_ , _conservation_ of total enzyme concentration, and assuming [steady state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^c2a80f).
	- This leads to a _universal_ description of steady-state enzyme kinetics
	- Rate equation: $v = \frac{V_{M}^{+}\frac{s}{K_S}-V_{M}^{-}\frac{p}{K_P}}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}$, known as the reversible Michaelis-Menten equation or Briggs-Haldane relationship. ^b464f5

### More complex enzyme kinetics

- Involve multiple substrates, products, effectors, and subunits.
	- Effectors: activators or inhibitors that bind to enzymes and affect their activity.
	- Subunits: a part of multimeric enzymes
- Their rate equations used later in mathematical models of the dynamics and regulation of metabolism.
- Two methods for deriving of enzyme kinetics:
	- **Rapid-equilibrium approximation**: fast and efficient, more approximate; this one is studied in this course
	- **Steady-state method**: more realistic, more complex
- Goal: understanding the rapid-equilibrium approximation approach and how _thermodynamics and kinetics_ are involved in such descriptions.

### Enzyme networks

- The activity of enzymes depends on their own _catalysis capability_ ($k^+, k^-$) and the concentration of the _reactants_ and the _effectors_ ($s, p$). The effectors and reactants are usually also part of other enzymatic reactions, forming a _reaction network_
- Multimeric enzymes are usually more _sensitive_ to regulation by distant compounds in the network than monomeric enzymes do.
	- Regulation by distant compounds happen via **feedforward or feedback allosteric loops**.
- The dynamics of metabolic network is regulated by:
	- conservation of chemical elements
	- enzyme kinetics
- The steady states are characterized by
	- _balanced_ net rates of _synthesis_ and _degradation_ of _each_ chemical compound
- Will make more sense later
	- from later: it makes sense now

### The bigger picture

- The regulation of metabolism, the regulation of gene expression, and their interoperation are subjected to evolutionary tuning.
- Although we have some understanding of how enzymes are regulated at the _molecular_ level, we still lack the understanding of how evolution pressure shapes such regulation and how _local_ regulations are coordinated to benefit the fitness (evolution context) at the _cell and organism_ level.

## Models of enzymes

### Proteins

- length: usually 300-400 aa/protein
- size: 5 nm in radius
- inter-protein distance: 10 nm
- **Diffusion** of protein in cells limits the reaction rates of their reactions.
- Protein life times vary greatly, from very stable metabolic proteins to other proteins that are subject to regulated degradations.
- Protein concentration vary as well, from a few copies per cell ([Transcription Factor](Biology/Concepts/Transcription%20Factor.md)s) to tens of thousands (metabolic enzymes)

### Protein functions

- **Structural** (ex. actin)
- **Regulatory** (ex. Ras, GPCR): regulate other processes
- **Enzymes**: catalyze reactions
- Regulatory proteins and enzymes can be described within the same kinetic framework, called the **rapid-equilibrium approximation**.

### Enzyme types

#### Motor proteins

- Dynein
	- Carries cellular cargo along microtubules
	- Each step it makes is a catalytic event
- $F_1F_0$ ATPase
	- With each turn it makes ATP
- Generally motor proteins hydrolyze ATP (lose phosphate) and exploit the harvested free energy to induce conformation changes.

#### Transporter proteins

- Transports molecules in and out of cells.
- Uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to open and close.

#### Metabolic enzymes

- Catalyze reactions in the cell.
- Speeds up reactions
- Couples energy consuming reactions to energy releasing reactions to make energy consuming reactions (such as synthesis of macromolecules) possible.

#### Monomeric vs. multimeric enzymes

- Feedback regulation (of [Metabolic enzymes](#Metabolic%20enzymes)) and ligand-binding activation or inhibition (of [Transcription Factor](Biology/Concepts/Transcription%20Factor.md)s) often apply to multimeric enzymes.
	- For example, activation of pyruvate kinase by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
- Monomeric enzymes are less sensitive.

### Enzyme catalysis can be described within one enzyme-kinetics formalism

![5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-02-19 23.42.31.excalidraw](Media/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%202025-02-19%2023.42.31.excalidraw.md)
- This describes a **catalytic event**
- A single catalytic event is _always_ cyclic, regardless of the exact enzyme function
- All enzyme state transitions can be described by mass action kinetics, i.e. $v_3 = k_3^+ep-k_3^-e\cdot p$ 
- All mathematical models of enzyme cycles are based on the same _reaction kinetics_, _thermodynamics_, and _mass conservation_ principles.
- Therefore, **one generally-applicable rate equation** for enzymes can be derived - the [Briggs-Haldane equation](#^b464f5)
	- This is a **net model** (a single $v$) of a [State Transition Diagram](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/2.%20VU%20BMBN%20State%20Transition%20Diagram.md) of an enzyme ($v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$)

## Mass action kinetics model of the catalytic cycle of enzymes

### Review: mass action kinetics

- [Mass action kinetics](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/3.%20VU%20BMBN%20Mass%20Action%20Kinetics%20and%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagrams.md#Mass%20action%20kinetics)
- $v$: reaction rate in unit of $\frac{\text{conc}}{\text{time}}$
- $v=v^+-v^-$
- General form:  $$\begin{aligned}&\sum_{i=1}^{k}m_i^+S_i\rightleftharpoons\sum_{j=1}^{l}n_j^-P_j\\&v=k^+\prod_{i=1}^ks_i^{m_i}-k^-\prod_{j=1}^lp_j^{n_j}\end{aligned}$$
- Reactions involving more than 2 substrates and 2 products are extremely unlikely due to the very low chance of spontaneous collisions.

### Association and dissociation constants

- [Dissociation constant](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Dissociation%20constant)
- A reaction $A+B\leftrightharpoons AB$ includes the:
	- associate reaction $A+B\rightarrow AB$
	- dissociation reaction $AB\rightarrow A+B$
- The net rate of
	- association: $v=k^+\cdot a\cdot b - k^-\cdot ab$
	- dissociation: $-v$
- At [equilibrium state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc), $v=0$
	- dissociation constant $K_D = \frac{a_e\cdot b_e}{ab_e} = \frac{k^-}{k^+}$
	- association constant $K_A= \frac{1}{K_D}$
	- unit: concentration

> 
> For the equilibrium reaction:
> 
> $E + S \rightleftharpoons ES$
> 
> where:
> 
> - $e$ = concentration of free enzyme EE,
>     
> - $s$ = concentration of substrate SS,
>     
> - $[ES]$ = concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex,
>     
> - $K$ = equilibrium constant, given by:
>     
>     $$K = \frac{[E][S]}{[ES]}$$
> 
> Rearranging:
> 
> $[ES] = \frac{e \cdot s}{K}$.
> 
> ### What Does Scaling by K Mean?
> 
> 1. K Represents the Tendency to Dissociate
>     
>     - The equilibrium constant KK is defined as $K = \frac{k_{\text{off}}}{k_{\text{on}}}$, where:
>         - $k_{\text{on}}$ is the rate at which $E$ and $S$ form $ES$.
>         - $k_{\text{off}}$ is the rate at which $ES$ dissociates into $E$ and $S$.
>     - A **higher** $K$ means the complex is more likely to dissociate (weaker binding), leading to **lower** $[ES]$.
>     - A **lower** $K$ means the complex is more stable (stronger binding), leading to **higher** $[ES]$.
> 1. Scaling by $K$ Adjusts for Affinity
>     
>     - The term $e \cdot s$ represents the raw likelihood of enzyme and substrate interacting.
>     - Dividing by $K$ corrects for how much of that interaction actually leads to complex formation.
>     - If K is **small** (strong binding), a larger fraction of $e \cdot s$ converts to $ES$.
>     - If K is **large** (weak binding), only a small fraction of $e \cdot s$ converts to $ES$.
> 1. Balancing Reactant and Product Concentrations
>     
>     - The ratio $\frac{e \cdot s}{K}$ ensures that, at equilibrium, the rate of complex formation matches the rate of dissociation.
>     - It reflects how much enzyme-substrate complex forms given the available enzyme and substrate, accounting for the **binding affinity** between them.
> 
> Essentially, it translates raw molecular encounters into an equilibrium-adjusted concentration of the bound complex.

### Rates of change in concentration

- Concentration of molecule as a function of time: $$x(t)=\frac{n_X(t)}{V}$$, where $n_X(t)$ is the _number_ of molecule $X$ at time $t$, and $V$ is the _volume_.
- Its derivative is: $$\frac{dx}{dt}=\frac{1}{V}\frac{dn_X}{dt}$$ shows that the concentration change is due to change in the number of X:
	- X is imported in or exported out of the system
	- X is used or created in reactions
- If the reactions that involve $X$ happens at rate $v_j$, in units $\frac{\text{number of reaction events}}{\text{volume}\times\text{time}}=\frac{\text{concentration events}}{\text{time}}$, then $\frac{dx}{dt}$ can also be described by: $$\frac{dx_i}{dt}=\sum^R_{j=1}n_{ij}v_j$$, where $n_{ij}$ is the stoichiometric coefficient of $X_i$ in reaction $j$, in units $\frac{\text{concentration}}{\text{concentration events}}$.
	- The stoichiometric coefficients gives the number of $X_i$ produced ($n_{ij}>0$) or consumed ($n_{ij}<0$) per single event of reaction $j$
	- $n\times v$ is in unit $\frac{\text{concentration}}{\text{time}}$, agreeing with $\frac{dx}{dt}$
	- Example [Answers](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Answers) - **differential equations**

### Mass-action kinetic model of a simple catalytic cycle

- Reactions: $$\begin{aligned}E+S&\overset{1}\leftrightharpoons ES\\ES&\overset{2}\leftrightharpoons EP\\EP&\overset{3}\leftrightharpoons E+P\end{aligned}$$
- **Reaction rates**: 
	- $$\begin{aligned}v_1&=k_1^+\cdot e\cdot s-k_1^-\cdot es\\v_2&=k_2^+\cdot es-k_2^-\cdot ep\\v_3&=k_3^+\cdot ep-k_3^-\cdot e\cdot p\end{aligned}$$
	- $v_1$: rate of binding to enzyme
	- $v_2$: rate of conversion
	- $v_3$: rate of releasing from enzyme
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{ds}{dt} &= -v_1\\\frac{de}{dt} &= -v_1 + v_3\\\frac{des}{dt} &= v_1 - v_2\\\frac{dep}{dt} &= v_2 - v_3\\\frac{dp}{dt} &= v_3\end{aligned}$$
- [Detailed balance](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Detailed%20balance): $$\frac{k_1^+k_2^+k_3^+s}{k_1^-k_2^-k_3^-p}=1$$
	- related to thermodynamics
	- constraints the combination of rate constants
- The differential equations can be solved: [Numerical solution to differential equations](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Numerical%20solution%20to%20differential%20equations) and concentration vs. time plotted for the reactants.

### Quasi-steady state regimes of catalytic cycles of enzymes

- See also WG5 jupyter notebook for reproduction of quasi-equilibrium figures
- In a biological situation, enzymatic reaction rates ($v_2$) are not 0.
- During cell growth at a fixed growth rate, metabolism operates at [steady state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^c2a80f)
	- the enzymatic reaction rates ($v_2$) are _constant_ and _unequal to 0_, and all reactant concentrations ($s$, $p$, $e$, $es$, $ep$) are also _constant_ 
		- **note** that the cell has constant supply of substrates and removal of products - an **open** system, $s$ and $p$ cannot be held constant in a closed system when the reaction rates are not 0 as $S$ is always getting used, and $P$ is always getting produced
	- for $v_2$ to be constant, $es$ and $ep$ must be constant: $$v_2=k_2^+\cdot es-k_2^-\cdot ep > 0$$
	- meaning that $$\begin{aligned}\frac{des}{dt} &= v_1 - v_2 = 0\\\frac{dep}{dt} &= v_2 - v_3 = 0\end{aligned}$$
	- so $v_1=v_2=v_3$
	- when 1 event of reaction 1 happens, 1 event of reaction 2 and 1 event of reaction 3 happen
- $v_1=v_2=v_3$ happens at [steady state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^c2a80f)
	- $s$ and $p$ are _constant_ at steady state
	- $E+S\overset{v_1}\leftrightharpoons ES \overset{v_2}\leftrightharpoons EP \overset{v_3}\leftrightharpoons E+P$
	- net rate (forward and reverse) of $S$ binding to $E$, $ES$ conversion to $EP$, and rate of $P$ releasing from $E$ must be equal, otherwise there would be build-up of $S$ or $P$ -> $v_1=v_2=v_3$
- $v_1=v_2=v_3$ can also happen when $s$ and $p$ are _varying_ but in **far excess** of the total amount of enzymes:
	- the $S$ and $P$ saturate all the enzymes present ($e=0$) such that formation of $ES$ and releasing from $EP$ happens at constant rate 
	- meaning that $$\begin{aligned}\frac{des}{dt} &= v_1 - v_2 = 0\\\frac{dep}{dt} &= v_2 - v_3 = 0\end{aligned}$$
	- so $v_1=v_2=v_3$
	- this is the **quasi-steady state**
- However, since it is a closed system, eventually $S$ runs out and $P$ accumulates. The condition that $S$ exists in great excess of $E$ breaks, and the system enters the [equilibrium state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc)
	- the forward and reverse of each reaction become balanced, the net rates become 0: $$\begin{aligned}v_1&=k_1^+\cdot e\cdot s-k_1^-\cdot es=0\\v_2&=k_2^+\cdot es-k_2^-\cdot ep=0\\v_3&=k_3^+\cdot ep-k_3^-\cdot e\cdot p=0\end{aligned}$$
	- all concentrations ($s$, $p$, $e$, $es$, $ep$) become _constant_
- The **quasi-steady state assumption**:  ^c97d87
	- assume enzymes are in the quasi-steady state where $\frac{des}{dt}=\frac{dep}{dt}=\frac{de}{dt}=0$ while $\frac{dp}{dt}$ and $\frac{ds}{dt}$ are not 0 when deriving the net model of enzyme state transition diagram
	- using this assumption, steady state kinetics can still be applied when the concentrations of the reactants are time-varying
	- the net model based on the quasi-steady state assumption holds for the quasi-steady state and after it transition to equilibrium state compared with the exact simulation
- The **quasi-equilibrium assumption**: ^cfb872
	- a further assumption based on the quasi-steady state assumption
	- assume that the rates of substrates binding ($v_1$) and products unbinding ($v_3$) reaches [equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc) rapidly and are 0: $v_1=v_2=0$, so the catalysis step ($v_2$) is the rate limiting step
		- binding and unbinding events referred to as "all state transitions associated with non-catalytic events" in the book
	- the net model based on the quasi-equilibrium assumption holds _only_ in the quasi-steady state region and not after it compared with the exact simulation
	- However, it is realistic _enough_ and in agreement with thermodynamics

## The quasi-equilibrium approximation for enzyme kinetics

### Binding polynomials

- Enzymes have:
	- Catalytic site: **reactants** and **effectors** can _bind_
	- Allosteric site: **effectors** can _bind_

#### Deriving the binding polynomial for the catalytic site of a simple enzyme

![5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-02-19 23.42.31.excalidraw](Media/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%202025-02-19%2023.42.31.excalidraw.md)
- Reaction: $E+S\overset{v_1}\leftrightharpoons ES \overset{v_2}\leftrightharpoons EP \overset{v_3}\leftrightharpoons E+P$
- Enzyme rate: $v_2 = k_2^+ es - k_2^- ep$
- (unbinding) reactions at [equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc): $v_1=v_3=0$
- Then the following are true:
	- Enzyme rate: $$v_2=k_2^+es-k_2^-ep$$
	- (un)binding reaction rates at equilibrium: $$\begin{aligned}v_1&=k_1^+\cdot e\cdot s-k_1^-\cdot es=0\\v_3&=k_3^+\cdot ep-k_3^-\cdot e\cdot p=0\end{aligned}$$
	- Equilibrium conditions: $$K_1=K_S=\frac{e\cdot s}{es}$$, $$K_3=K_P=\frac{e\cdot p}{ep}$$, $K$s being [Equilibrium constants](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Equilibrium%20constants) as well as [dissociation constants](#Association%20and%20dissociation%20constants). They describe how much complex is dissociated vs. bound
	- the _total enzyme_ concentration = the concentration of the _enzyme states of the catalytic site_ summed (one site per enzyme): $$e_T=e+es+ep=e+\frac{e\cdot s}{K_S}+\frac{e\cdot p}{K_P}$$
		- $e$: catalytic site unbound
		- $es$: catalytic site bounded to substrate
		- $ep$: catalytic site bounded to product
		- [conceptual interpretation](#^293c15)
	- solving for $e$: $$\begin{aligned}e_T&=e+es+ep\\e_T&=e(1+\frac{es}{e}+\frac{ep}{p})\\e_T&=e(1+\frac{1}{e}\frac{e\cdot s}{K_S}+\frac{1}{e}\frac{e\cdot p}{K_P})\\e_T&=e(1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P})\\e&=e_T\frac{1}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}\end{aligned}$$
		- from the above, we define the binding polynomial to be $\frac{e_T}{e}$: $$\mathcal{B}=\frac{e_T}{e}=\underbrace{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}_{\text{binding polynomial}}$$

#### Conceptual interpretations of the binding polynomial

- The binding polynomial is defined as $$\begin{aligned}&\mathcal{B}=\frac{e_T}{e}=\underbrace{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}_{\text{binding polynomial}}\end{aligned}$$
	- $\frac{e_{T}}{e}$: how much enzyme is free
		- high value: low $e$ relative to $e_{T}$, most is bound
		- $\approx 1$: higher $e$, mostly free
		- note that $e_{T}$ is constant and $e$ cannot be larger than $e_{T}$, so the maximum value is 1
	- binding polynomial: contribution of free enzyme + bound to substrate + bound to product
	-  $\frac{e_{T}}{e}$ decreases whenever substrate or product binds to free enzymes


#### Binding polynomials for allosteric site

- If there is also an allosteric site that can bind to an inhibitor $I$, then the following reactions would exist: $$ \begin{aligned}E+I&\overset{4}\leftrightharpoons IE\\ES+I&\overset{5}\leftrightharpoons IES\\EP+I&\overset{6}\leftrightharpoons IEP\end{aligned}$$
- The enzyme conservation becomes:$$\begin{aligned}e_{T}=e+ie+es+ies+ep+iep\end{aligned}$$
- Assuming the binding affinity of $I$ is the same for $ES$, $EP$, and $E$, and using the rapid equilibrium assumption, which says that (un)binding reactions proceed at rate = 0: $$ie=\frac{e\cdot i}{K_{I}},\quad ies=\frac{es\cdot i}{K_{I}},\quad iep=\frac{ep\cdot i}{K_{I}}$$
- Then the conservation equation is written as: $$e_{T}=e+\frac{e\cdot i}{K_{I}}+\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}}+\frac{es\cdot i}{K_{I}}+\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}+\frac{ep\cdot i}{K_{I}}$$
	- Since $es=\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}}$ and $ep=\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}$, the above equation equals to: $$e_{T}=e+\frac{e\cdot i}{K_{I}}+\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}}+\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}}\frac{i}{K_{I}}+\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}+\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}\frac{i}{K_{I}}$$
- The binding polynomial thus equal to: $$
\mathcal{B}=\frac{e_{T}}{e}=1+\frac{i}{K_{I}}+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{i\cdot s}{K_{I}K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot i}{K_{I}K_{P}}=\underbrace{ \underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K_{I}} \right) }_{\text{binding polynomial of the allosteric site, }\mathcal{A}}\quad\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right) }_{ \text{binding polynomial of the catalytic site, }\mathcal{C} } }_{  \text{binding polynomial of the enzyme, }\mathcal{B}}
$$
- When binding sites act _independent_ of each other, the binding polynomial of the enzyme can be _factored_ into binding polynomials of each binding site. In this case, $\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{C}\cdot\mathcal{A}$

#### Binding polynomial for 2 substrates and 2 products

##### Situation 1

- Consider the reaction $A+B\leftrightharpoons P + Q$
- One of the ways it can take place is: ![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-07 14.37.04.excalidraw]]
- Observe that $A$ and $P$ do not bind together, and $B$ and $Q$ do not bind together. This means that $A$ and $P$ compete for a binding site, and $B$ and $Q$ compete for a binding site. There are 2 binding sites in total.
- Its binding polynomial is derived as the following: $$\begin{aligned}e_{T}&=e+ae+pe+eb+eq+aeb+peb+aeq+peq\\e_{T}&=e+\frac{a\cdot e}{K_{A}}+\frac{p\cdot e}{K_{P}}+\frac{b\cdot e}{K_{B}}+\frac{q\cdot e}{K_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot e\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p\cdot e\cdot b}{K_{P}K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot e\cdot q}{K_{A}K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot e\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}\\e_{T}&=e\left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p\cdot b}{K_{P}K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot q}{K_{A}K_{Q}}+ \frac{e\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}\right)\\\frac{e_{T}}{e}&=\underbrace{ \underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right) }_{ \text{Binding polynomial of catalytic site }\mathcal{C_{1}}\quad}\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}} \right) }_{ \text{Binding polynomial of catalytic site }\mathcal{C_{2}} } }_{ \text{Binding polynomial of the catalytic sites }\mathcal{B}}\end{aligned}$$
	- $aeb$ can be considered as $a\cdot e\cdot b$. The order of whether $a$ or $b$ binds first does not matter as we assume binding of $a$ does not affect binding of $b$ and vice versa
- Note that the binding polynomial matches our intuition from the state transition diagram: A and P competes for a binding site and B and Q competes for a binding site

##### Situation 2

![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-21 15.07.55.excalidraw]]

- In this case, the substrates and the products do not bind together. It could be that the binding of a substrate changes the conformation such that it can only bind to other substrates and vice versa.
- Its binding polynomial is derived as the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
e_{T}&=e+pe+eq+peq+eb+ae+aeb\\
e_{T}&=e+\frac{p\cdot e}{K_{P}}+\frac{e\cdot q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot e\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{e\cdot b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot e}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot e\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}\\
\frac{e_{T}}{e}&=1+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- Note that this cannot be factored, matching our description that the two binding sites are _not independent_ and the state transition diagram that P and Q bind together and A and B bind together.

##### Situation 3

![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-23 21.04.42.excalidraw]]
- In this case, the binding is sequential. B or Q cannot bind to the enzyme by themselves. Products and substrates also do not bind simultaneously.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{e_{T}}{e}=\underbrace{ 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} }_{ \text{binding polynomial of the catalytic site of the enzyme (does not factorize)} }
\end{aligned}

- The reaction: $$E+S\overset{v_1}\leftrightharpoons ES \overset{v_2}\leftrightharpoons EP \overset{v_3}\leftrightharpoons E+P$$
- 1. Write down the **enzyme conservation**: $$e_{T}=e+es+ep$$
- 2. Write down the **rate limiting reaction**, which is the catalytic step: $$v=v_{2}=k_{2}^+es-k_{2}^-ep$$
- 3. Write down the concentration of enzyme-reactant complexes in terms of _dissociation constants_ and the concentrations of the _free enzyme_ and the _reactants_: $$es=\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}},ep=\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}$$
- 4. Substitute step 3 into step 1 to obtain the free enzyme concentration: $$e_{T}=e+es+ep=e+\frac{e\cdot s}{K_{S}}+\frac{e\cdot p}{K_{P}}\rightarrow e=\frac{e_{T}}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}$$
	- expresses the free enzyme concentration in terms of total enzyme, substrate and produce concentration, and kinetic parameters of the reaction.
	- $1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}$ is the binding polynomial
- 5. Substitute $e$ in step 4 into step 3: $$es=e_T\frac{\frac{s}{K_S}}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}, ep=e_T\frac{\frac{p}{K_P}}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}$$
- 6. Substitute step 5 into step 2: $$\begin{aligned}v_2&=k^+_2es-k_2^-ep\\&=\frac{k_2^+e_T\frac{s}{K_S}-k_2^-e_T\frac{p}{K_P}}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}\end{aligned}$$
- 7. Identify the maximal forward and backward rates: $$v=\frac{V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_{S}}-V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_{P}}}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}, V_{M}^+=k_{2}^+e_{T},V_{M}^-=k_{2}^-e_{T}$$
#### Conceptual interpretation of rate equation

- $k_2^+e_T\frac{s}{K_S}$: $\text{how fast the reaction goes forward}\cdot \text{how much total enzyme is available}\cdot \text{substrate availability relative to binding strength}$
	- $k_{2}^+e_{T}$ represents the maximum forward reaction rate. Which happens when all of the enzyme is bound ($es$). The maximal rate is scaled by $\frac{s}{K_{S}}$
	- High $\frac{s}{K_{S}}$ means lots of substrate and little dissociation of $es$, so most of the substrates become bound, forward reaction happens more
	- Low $\frac{s}{K_{S}}$ means little substrate and high dissociation $es$, so most of the substrates are free, reverse reaction happens more
- Dividing  $V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_S}-V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_P}$ by the binding polynomial scales the raw forward and backward rate with how much free enzyme is available
	- When there is already substrate and product binding to enzymes, free enzyme concentration drops, $\frac{e_{T}}{e}$ increases, dropping the net reaction rate
	- When there is fewer free enzymes, substrates and products have a lower chance to bind to an enzyme and start the reaction
-  $e=\frac{e_{T}}{1+\frac{s}{K_S}+\frac{p}{K_P}}$ can be factored from the rate equation, representing the free enzyme available.

$$, and $$V_{M}=\text{forward or reverse rate constant}\cdot e_{T}$$

### Quick derivation of rapid-equilibrium enzyme kinetics using the binding polynomials of its catalytic and allosteric sites

- The general form of the rate equation of a monomeric enzyme using the rapid equilibrium method: $$
v=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}-V_{M}^-\prod_{j} \frac{p_{j}}{K_{P_{j}}}}{\mathcal{B}}
$$, while the binding polynomial can be a product of the binding polynomial of its _independent_ allosteric and catalytic sites: $$\mathcal{B}=\prod_{k}\mathcal{C_{k}}\times \prod_{l}\mathcal{A_{l}}$$
 
 
#### The Haldane relationship

- At thermodynamic equilibrium: $$\begin{aligned}
v&=0\\
V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i,e}}{K_{S_{i}}} &= V_{M}^-\prod_{j} \frac{p_{j,e}}{K_{P_{j}}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i}s_{i,e}}{V_{M}^-\prod_{j}p_{j,e}}=\frac{\prod_{j} \frac{1}{K_{P_{j}}}}{\prod_{i} \frac{1}{K_{S_{i}}}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i}s_{i,e}}{V_{M}^-\prod_{j}p_{j,e}}=\frac{\prod_{i}K_{S_{i}}}{\prod_{j}K_{P_{j}}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{j}K_{P_{j}}}{V_{M}^-\prod_{i}K_{S_{i}}}=\frac{\prod_{j}p_{j,e}}{\prod_{i}s_{i,e}}
\end{aligned}$$
- The Haldane relationship relates the _enzyme kinetic parameters_ to the _equilibrium constant_
- It constrains the enzyme kinetic parameters such that they cannot be freely chosen
- The general form of monomeric enzyme rate equation can then be written as: $$\begin{aligned}
v&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}-V_{M}^-\prod_{j} \frac{p_{j}}{K_{P_{j}}}}{\mathcal{B}}\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}\left( 1-\frac{V_{M}^-\prod_{j} \frac{p_{j}}{K_{P_{j}}}}{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}} \right)}{\mathcal{B}}\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}\left( 1- \frac{\prod_{j} p_{j}}{K_{eq}\prod_{i} s_{i}} \right)}{\mathcal{B}}
\end{aligned}
