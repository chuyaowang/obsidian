## Exercise

- For the reaction $R+S\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons RS$,
- Give the **differential equations for the concentrations**, and the **mass action kinetics**
- Reduce the number of differential equations by using the **conservation of the total number of receptors**. 
	- Assume that the small molecule is in _great excess_ relative to the concentration of receptors. Such that the _free concentration of small molecule_ remains approximately constant, despite the small molecule binding to the receptor.
- Show/proof that the conservation equations for the total concentrations that you used are correct, using the differential equations.

### Answers

- **Mass action kinetics**: $v = k^+r\times s - k^- rs$
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr}{dt}&=-v\\\frac{ds}{dt}&=-v\\\frac{drs}{dt}&=v\end{aligned}$$
- **Conservation**: $$\begin{aligned}r_{tot}&=r+rs\\s_{tot}&=s+rs\end{aligned}$$
	- Since $S$ is in great excess, $s_{tot}\approx s$, meaning the amount bounded to $R$ is negligible
- **Simplification**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{drs}{dt}&=v\\&=k^+r\times s - k^- rs\\&=k^+(r_{tot}-rs)\times s_{tot}-k^- rs\end{aligned}$$
- This is a simplification because we do not need $r$ or $s$ in the differential equation anymore. $r_{tot}$ and $s_{tot}$ are constants.

### Proof 

- Prove that:
	- $r_{tot}=r+rs$
	- $s_{tot}=s+rs$
- Take the derivative:
	- $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_{tot}}{dt}&=\frac{dr}{dt}+\frac{drs}{dt}\\&=-v+v\\&=0\end{aligned}$$
		- Because $r_{tot}$ does not change, its derivative is 0
	- Similar for $s_{tot}$

## Exercise 2

- Reaction: $R+R\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons R_2$

### Answers

- **Rate equations**: $v = k^+r^2 - k^- r_2$
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr}{dt}&=-2v\\\frac{dr_2}{dt}&=v\end{aligned}$$
- **Conservation**: $$r_{tot} = r+2r_2$$
- Why the 2s: each molecule of $r_2$ is made of 2 $r$ monomers
- **Simplification**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_2}{dt}&=v\\&=k^+r^2 - k^- r_2\\&=k^+(r_{tot}-2r_2)^2-k^-r_2\end{aligned}$$

### Proof

- Prove the conservation
- $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_{tot}}{dt}&=\frac{dr}{dt}+2\frac{dr_2}{dt}\\&=-2v+2v\\&=0\end{aligned}$$

## A bigger model

- How many conservation relations hold (how many relations exist that relate concentrations to a total concentration value): **3** for $r_{tot}$, $g_{tot}$, $s_{tot}$
- Write them down: $$\begin{aligned}s_{tot}&=s+rs+sr_2+r_2s+2r_2s_2+2gr_2s_2+2r_2s_2g+4r_2s_2gr_2s_2\\r_{tot}&=r+rs+2r_2+2sr_2+2r_2s+2r_2s_2+2gr_2s_2+2r_2s_2g+4r_2s_2gr_2s_2\\g_{tot}&=g+gr_2s_2+r_2s_2g+r_2s_2gr_2s_2\end{aligned}$$
- The conservation equation should contain all compounds that contains the respective molecule ($s$, $r$, or $g$)

## Numerical solution to differential equations

- Computationally solve the differential equations
- Consider the reaction from [Exercise 2](#Exercise%202)
- Add to the computer its **rate equations**, **differential equations**, and **initial values**
- The **initial values** contain:
	- values for $k^+$ and $k^-$
	- values for $r(0)$ and $r_2(0)$
	- See WG2 for how computer solves an _initial value problem_
- The computer then computes $r$ and $r_2$ as a function of _time_ as: $$\begin{aligned}r(t+\Delta t)&\approx r(t)+\frac{dr(t)}{dt}\Delta t=r(t)-2v\Delta t\\r_{2}(t+\Delta t)&\approx r_{2}(t)+\frac{dr_{2}(t)}{dt}\Delta t=r_{2}(t)+v\Delta t\end{aligned}$$
- We get a plot of **concentration vs. time**
	- The system moves to a [Stationary state](#Stationary%20state), in which the concentrations are _constant_ (differential equation becomes 0)
	- This means $v$ becomes 0 ([equilibrium state](#^aca7bc))
	- When reaction rates are 0 in a stationary state, this stationary state is called _a state of (thermodynamic) equilibrium_ or _equilibrium state_

### Calculate the concentrations of $R$ and $R_2$ at the equilibrium state

- At the equilibrium state the concentrations are **constants**
- $$\begin{aligned}&v=k^{+}\cdot r_{e}^{2}-k^{-}\cdot r_{2,e}=0\Rightarrow r_{2,e}=\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}\\&r_{tot}=r+2r_{2}=r_{e}+2\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}\Rightarrow2\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}+r_{e}-r_{tot}=0\\&r_{e}=\frac{1}{4}\left(-4-\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}+\frac{\sqrt{k^{-}(k^{-}+8k^{+})}}{k^{+}}+4r_{tot}\right)\end{aligned}$$, where $r_e$ and $r_{2,e}$ are equilibrium concentrations
- Explanation
	- Line 1: at the equilibrium the reaction rate is 0
	- Line 2: the equilibrium concentrations also follow the conservation rule
		- substitute $r_{2,e}$ in terms of $r_e$
	- Line 3: solve for $r_e$. There are 2 solutions, but only 1 is positive.

#### $r_{tot}$ must be greater than 0 to have a solution

- The solution can also be written as: $$r_e=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4\cdot2\frac{k^-}{k^+}\cdot r_{tot}}}{2\cdot 2\frac{k^-}{k^+}}$$ using the quadratic formula
- When the sign is minus, the concentration is negative
- When the sign is positive and the square root is greater than 1, meaning $r_{tot} > 0$ (can be shown), $r_e$ is positive

## Stationary state

- **Stationary state**: a state of the system when all _concentrations are constant in time_.
	- All the differential equations equal to 0.
- Three types of stationary states:
	- An **equilibrium state**: all reaction rates are 0; ^aca7bc
	- A **steady state**: none of the reaction rates are 0; ^c2a80f
	- A **steady state with an equilibrium segment**: some of the reaction rates are zero.
	- It is important to distinguish an equilibrium state and a steady state
- Stationary state is an example of **attracting states**: when one stationary state exists, all initial conditions of the model is _attracted_ to the stationary state.
- **State space**: each state of a system is defined by its combination of variables (concentrations). For a system with 3 variables, its states are points in a 3 dimensional space.
- In the state space of the dynamical system, a stationary state is a point that attracts other states, called a _point attractor_. The movement of the initial to the stationary state forms a trajectory in the state space.
- Other types of attracting states:
	- **Limit cycle with single period**: an _oscillation_ with a single period. This forms a circle in the state space. Each point in the circle is revisited after a period.
	- **Limit cycle with multiple periods**: a more complex oscillation with multiple periods, but each point is still visited periodically.
	- **Strange attractor**: the curve in the state space never crosses itself. not periodic and the states are never revisited.

## Equilibrium constants

- Each reaction has an [equilibrium](#^aca7bc) constant $K_{eq}$
- Consider the reaction from [Exercise 2](#Exercise%202), its equilibrium constant is defined as: $$v=k^+\cdot r_e^2-k^-r_{2,e}=0\Rightarrow\frac{r_e^2}{r_{2,e}}=\frac{k^-}{k^+}=K_{eq}$$
- An equilibrium constant relates the concentrations the 2 reactants: $$v=k^+r^2-k^-r_2=k^+r^2\left(1-\frac{k^-r_2}{k^+r^2}\right)=k^+r^2\left(1-\frac{r_2}{r^2K_{eq}}\right)$$
- Why do we consider $K_{eq}$?
	- They are often tabulated. So when 1 $k$ is known, the other can be calculated.

### Standard formation energy



## Detailed balance

![](Pasted%20image%2020250212101020.png)
- In a _cyclic reaction_, such as the one shown above, the product can be formed either via reaction 2 to 5 or 3 to 4. In this case, it can be shown that the [Equilibrium constants](#Equilibrium%20constants) must obey the relationship $$\frac{K_3K_4}{K_2K_5}=1$$, placing a constraint on the equilibrium constants.
- This is called _detailed balance_ or _microscopic reversibility_, and holds for all cyclic segments in a [State Transition Diagram](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/2.%20VU%20BMBN%20State%20Transition%20Diagram.md) (where transitions are described by mass balance).

## Dissociation constant

- Consider this reaction: $A+B\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons AB$
- $v = k^+a\times b - k^- ab$
- $$\begin{aligned}a_{tot}&=a+ab\\b_{tot}&=b+ab\end{aligned}$$
- Then at equilibrium, its **equilibrium constant** and **dissociation constant** are defined as: $$K_{eq}=\frac{a_e\cdot b_e}{ab_e}=\frac{k^-}{k^+}=K_D$$
- The **association constant** is defined as the inverse of the dissociation constant: $K_A = K_D^{-1}$

## Belousov Zhabotinsky Reaction

- Pattern formation from reaction

### Explanation

Circular patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction arise due to the underlying dynamics of **reaction-diffusion systems**â€”a class of systems in which chemical reactions interact with the diffusion of reactants. This combination creates **spatiotemporal patterns**, such as spirals, target waves, and concentric rings. The formation of circular patterns is primarily driven by **self-organization** resulting from feedback mechanisms and instabilities.

#### Key Mechanisms Behind Circular Patterns

1. **Autocatalysis and Inhibition Feedback**  
    The BZ reaction is a classic example of an **oscillatory chemical reaction** where the concentration of certain intermediates (such as bromous acid $\text{HBrO}_2$) oscillates periodically. The process involves two key types of feedback:
    
    - **Positive feedback (Autocatalysis)**: Increases the concentration of certain reactants quickly.
    - **Negative feedback (Inhibition)**: Slows the reaction, creating periodic drops in concentration.
    
    These two feedback loops result in a rhythmic cycle that produces periodic changes in color, typically from red to blue in BZ reactions with ferroin indicator.
    
2. **Reaction-Diffusion Model**  
    The BZ reaction follows a **reaction-diffusion mechanism**, which is mathematically described by a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for the reactant concentrations: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,v)+D_u\nabla^2u,\quad\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=g(u,v)+D_v\nabla^2v$$
    
    Here:
    
    - $u$ and $v$ represent concentrations of two chemical species.
    - $f(u, v)$ and $g(u, v)$ describe the chemical reaction terms.
    - $D_u$ and $D_v$ are the diffusion coefficients for the two species.
      
3. **Formation of Circular (Target) Patterns**
    
    - **Localized Perturbations**: If a small perturbation occurs at a point in the system, it can initiate a chemical wave that spreads outward in all directions, forming concentric rings or circular waves.
    - **Wave Propagation and Refractory Zones**: After a wavefront passes through a region, that region becomes temporarily refractoryâ€”unresponsive to further stimulationâ€”due to depletion of reactants or inhibitory feedback. This ensures that new waves originate from the center of the circular pattern and propagate outward.
    - **Self-sustaining Oscillations**: The oscillating nature of the BZ reaction, combined with diffusion, maintains the wave-like structure.
      
4. **Turing Instabilities**  
    - Alan Turingâ€™s theory of pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems provides a mathematical explanation for the emergence of spatial structures. Circular patterns can form in regions where the reaction-diffusion equations exhibit **Turing instabilities**, which lead to periodic structures like concentric rings.
    

#### Summary of Factors Influencing Circular Patterns

- **Initial conditions**: Perturbations or local fluctuations in the concentration of reactants.
- **Diffusion rates**: Affects how quickly wavefronts spread outward.
- **Reaction kinetics**: The balance between autocatalysis and inhibition drives periodic wave formation.
- **Refractory period**: Ensures spatial separation between successive waves, creating distinct concentric rings.
