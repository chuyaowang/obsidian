## Exercise

- For the reaction $R+S\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons RS$,
- Give the **differential equations for the concentrations**, and the **mass action kinetics**
- Reduce the number of differential equations by using the **conservation of the total number of receptors**. 
	- Assume that the small molecule is in _great excess_ relative to the concentration of receptors. Such that the _free concentration of small molecule_ remains approximately constant, despite the small molecule binding to the receptor.
- Show/proof that the conservation equations for the total concentrations that you used are correct, using the differential equations.

### Answers

- **Mass action kinetics**: $v = k^+r\times s - k^- rs$
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr}{dt}&=-v\\\frac{ds}{dt}&=-v\\\frac{drs}{dt}&=v\end{aligned}$$
- **Conservation**: $$\begin{aligned}r_{tot}&=r+rs\\s_{tot}&=s+rs\end{aligned}$$
	- Since $S$ is in great excess, $s_{tot}\approx s$, meaning the amount bounded to $R$ is negligible
- **Simplification**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{drs}{dt}&=v\\&=k^+r\times s - k^- rs\\&=k^+(r_{tot}-rs)\times s_{tot}-k^- rs\end{aligned}$$
- This is a simplification because we do not need $r$ or $s$ in the differential equation anymore. $r_{tot}$ and $s_{tot}$ are constants.

### Proof 

- Prove that:
	- $r_{tot}=r+rs$
	- $s_{tot}=s+rs$
- Take the derivative:
	- $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_{tot}}{dt}&=\frac{dr}{dt}+\frac{drs}{dt}\\&=-v+v\\&=0\end{aligned}$$
		- Because $r_{tot}$ does not change, its derivative is 0
	- Similar for $s_{tot}$

## Exercise 2

- Reaction: $R+R\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons R_2$

### Answers

- **Rate equations**: $v = k^+r^2 - k^- r_2$
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr}{dt}&=-2v\\\frac{dr_2}{dt}&=v\end{aligned}$$
- **Conservation**: $$r_{tot} = r+2r_2$$
- Why the 2s: each molecule of $r_2$ is made of 2 $r$ monomers
- **Simplification**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_2}{dt}&=v\\&=k^+r^2 - k^- r_2\\&=k^+(r_{tot}-2r_2)^2-k^-r_2\end{aligned}$$

### Proof

- Prove the conservation
- $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dr_{tot}}{dt}&=\frac{dr}{dt}+2\frac{dr_2}{dt}\\&=-2v+2v\\&=0\end{aligned}$$

## A bigger model

- How many conservation relations hold (how many relations exist that relate concentrations to a total concentration value): **3** for $r_{tot}$, $g_{tot}$, $s_{tot}$
- Write them down: $$\begin{aligned}s_{tot}&=s+rs+sr_2+r_2s+2r_2s_2+2gr_2s_2+2r_2s_2g+4r_2s_2gr_2s_2\\r_{tot}&=r+rs+2r_2+2sr_2+2r_2s+2r_2s_2+2gr_2s_2+2r_2s_2g+4r_2s_2gr_2s_2\\g_{tot}&=g+gr_2s_2+r_2s_2g+r_2s_2gr_2s_2\end{aligned}$$
- The conservation equation should contain all compounds that contains the respective molecule ($s$, $r$, or $g$)

## Numerical solution to differential equations

- Computationally solve the differential equations
- Consider the reaction from [Exercise 2](#Exercise%202)
- Add to the computer its **rate equations**, **differential equations**, and **initial values**
- The **initial values** contain:
	- values for $k^+$ and $k^-$
	- values for $r(0)$ and $r_2(0)$
	- See WG2 for how computer solves an _initial value problem_
- The computer then computes $r$ and $r_2$ as a function of _time_ as: $$\begin{aligned}r(t+\Delta t)&\approx r(t)+\frac{dr(t)}{dt}\Delta t=r(t)-2v\Delta t\\r_{2}(t+\Delta t)&\approx r_{2}(t)+\frac{dr_{2}(t)}{dt}\Delta t=r_{2}(t)+v\Delta t\end{aligned}$$
- We get a plot of **concentration vs. time**
	- The system moves to a [Stationary state](#Stationary%20state), in which the concentrations are _constant_ (differential equation becomes 0)
	- This means $v$ becomes 0 ([equilibrium state](#^aca7bc))
	- When reaction rates are 0 in a stationary state, this stationary state is called _a state of (thermodynamic) equilibrium_ or _equilibrium state_

### Calculate the concentrations of $R$ and $R_2$ at the equilibrium state

- At the equilibrium state the concentrations are **constants**
- $$\begin{aligned}&v=k^{+}\cdot r_{e}^{2}-k^{-}\cdot r_{2,e}=0\Rightarrow r_{2,e}=\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}\\&r_{tot}=r+2r_{2}=r_{e}+2\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}\Rightarrow2\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}r_{e}^{2}+r_{e}-r_{tot}=0\\&r_{e}=\frac{1}{4}\left(-4-\frac{k^{-}}{k^{+}}+\frac{\sqrt{k^{-}(k^{-}+8k^{+})}}{k^{+}}+4r_{tot}\right)\end{aligned}$$, where $r_e$ and $r_{2,e}$ are equilibrium concentrations
- Explanation
	- Line 1: at the equilibrium the reaction rate is 0
	- Line 2: the equilibrium concentrations also follow the conservation rule
		- substitute $r_{2,e}$ in terms of $r_e$
	- Line 3: solve for $r_e$. There are 2 solutions, but only 1 is positive.

#### $r_{tot}$ must be greater than 0 to have a solution

- The solution can also be written as: $$r_e=\frac{-1\pm\sqrt{1+4\cdot2\frac{k^-}{k^+}\cdot r_{tot}}}{2\cdot 2\frac{k^-}{k^+}}$$ using the quadratic formula
- When the sign is minus, the concentration is negative
- When the sign is positive and the square root is greater than 1, meaning $r_{tot} > 0$ (can be shown), $r_e$ is positive

## Stationary state

- **Stationary state**: a state of the system when all _concentrations are constant in time_.
	- All the differential equations equal to 0.
- Three types of stationary states:
	- An **equilibrium state**: all reaction rates are 0; ^aca7bc
	- A **steady state**: none of the reaction rates are 0; ^c2a80f
	- A **steady state with an equilibrium segment**: some of the reaction rates are zero.
	- It is important to distinguish an equilibrium state and a steady state
- Stationary state is an example of **attracting states**: when one stationary state exists, all initial conditions of the model is _attracted_ to the stationary state.
- **State space**: each state of a system is defined by its combination of variables (concentrations). For a system with 3 variables, its states are points in a 3 dimensional space.
- In the state space of the dynamical system, a stationary state is a point that attracts other states, called a _point attractor_. The movement of the initial to the stationary state forms a trajectory in the state space.
- Other types of attracting states:
	- **Limit cycle with single period**: an _oscillation_ with a single period. This forms a circle in the state space. Each point in the circle is revisited after a period.
	- **Limit cycle with multiple periods**: a more complex oscillation with multiple periods, but each point is still visited periodically.
	- **Strange attractor**: the curve in the state space never crosses itself. not periodic and the states are never revisited.

## Equilibrium constants

- Each reaction has an [equilibrium](#^aca7bc) constant $K_{eq}$
- Consider the reaction from [Exercise 2](#Exercise%202), its equilibrium constant is defined as: $$v=k^+\cdot r_e^2-k^-r_{2,e}=0\Rightarrow\frac{r_e^2}{r_{2,e}}=\frac{k^-}{k^+}=K_{eq}$$
- An equilibrium constant relates the concentrations the 2 reactants: $$v=k^+r^2-k^-r_2=k^+r^2\left(1-\frac{k^-r_2}{k^+r^2}\right)=k^+r^2\left(1-\frac{r_2}{r^2K_{eq}}\right)$$
- Why do we consider $K_{eq}$?
	- They are often tabulated. So when 1 $k$ is known, the other can be calculated.

### Standard formation energy



## Detailed balance

![](Pasted%20image%2020250212101020.png)
- In a _cyclic reaction_, such as the one shown above, the product can be formed either via reaction 2 to 5 or 3 to 4. In this case, it can be shown that the [Equilibrium constants](#Equilibrium%20constants) must obey the relationship $$\frac{K_3K_4}{K_2K_5}=1$$, placing a constraint on the equilibrium constants.
- This is called _detailed balance_ or _microscopic reversibility_, and holds for all cyclic segments in a [State Transition Diagram](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/2.%20VU%20BMBN%20State%20Transition%20Diagram.md) (where transitions are described by mass balance).

## Dissociation constant

- Consider this reaction: $A+B\overset{v}\rightleftharpoons AB$
- $v = k^+a\times b - k^- ab$
- $$\begin{aligned}a_{tot}&=a+ab\\b_{tot}&=b+ab\end{aligned}$$
- Then at equilibrium, its **equilibrium constant** and **dissociation constant** are defined as: $$K_{eq}=\frac{a_e\cdot b_e}{ab_e}=\frac{k^-}{k^+}=K_D$$
- The **association constant** is defined as the inverse of the dissociation constant: $K_A = K_D^{-1}$

## Belousov Zhabotinsky Reaction

- Pattern formation from reaction

### Explanation

Circular patterns in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction arise due to the underlying dynamics of **reaction-diffusion systems**—a class of systems in which chemical reactions interact with the diffusion of reactants. This combination creates **spatiotemporal patterns**, such as spirals, target waves, and concentric rings. The formation of circular patterns is primarily driven by **self-organization** resulting from feedback mechanisms and instabilities.

#### Key Mechanisms Behind Circular Patterns

1. **Autocatalysis and Inhibition Feedback**  
    The BZ reaction is a classic example of an **oscillatory chemical reaction** where the concentration of certain intermediates (such as bromous acid $\text{HBrO}_2$) oscillates periodically. The process involves two key types of feedback:
    
    - **Positive feedback (Autocatalysis)**: Increases the concentration of certain reactants quickly.
    - **Negative feedback (Inhibition)**: Slows the reaction, creating periodic drops in concentration.
    
    These two feedback loops result in a rhythmic cycle that produces periodic changes in color, typically from red to blue in BZ reactions with ferroin indicator.
    
2. **Reaction-Diffusion Model**  
    The BZ reaction follows a **reaction-diffusion mechanism**, which is mathematically described by a set of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) for the reactant concentrations: $$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}=f(u,v)+D_u\nabla^2u,\quad\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}=g(u,v)+D_v\nabla^2v$$
    
    Here:
    
    - $u$ and $v$ represent concentrations of two chemical species.
    - $f(u, v)$ and $g(u, v)$ describe the chemical reaction terms.
    - $D_u$ and $D_v$ are the diffusion coefficients for the two species.
      
3. **Formation of Circular (Target) Patterns**
    
    - **Localized Perturbations**: If a small perturbation occurs at a point in the system, it can initiate a chemical wave that spreads outward in all directions, forming concentric rings or circular waves.
    - **Wave Propagation and Refractory Zones**: After a wavefront passes through a region, that region becomes temporarily refractory—unresponsive to further stimulation—due to depletion of reactants or inhibitory feedback. This ensures that new waves originate from the center of the circular pattern and propagate outward.
    - **Self-sustaining Oscillations**: The oscillating nature of the BZ reaction, combined with diffusion, maintains the wave-like structure.
      
4. **Turing Instabilities**  
    - Alan Turing’s theory of pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems provides a mathematical explanation for the emergence of spatial structures. Circular patterns can form in regions where the reaction-diffusion equations exhibit **Turing instabilities**, which lead to periodic structures like concentric rings.
    

#### Summary of Factors Influencing Circular Patterns

- **Initial conditions**: Perturbations or local fluctuations in the concentration of reactants.
- **Diffusion rates**: Affects how quickly wavefronts spread outward.
- **Reaction kinetics**: The balance between autocatalysis and inhibition drives periodic wave formation.
- **Refractory period**: Ensures spatial separation between successive waves, creating distinct concentric rings.
