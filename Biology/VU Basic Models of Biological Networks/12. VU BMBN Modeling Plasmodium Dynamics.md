## Plasmodium

- Blood transmitted parasite
- Mosquitos bite infected blood and transmits the gametocytes to next host in next biting
- Plasmodium growth in the host causes immune responses
- Plasmodium resides in red blood cell and its metabolism interacts with that of red blood cells

## Building a whole body model

- Detailed model at the drug target
- More coarse grained modeling at the whole body level
- Goal: find an enzyme that once inhibited can kill the parasite
- Parasite infection causes hypoglycaemia and lactic acidosis, but the mechanism that leads to this change needs to be investigated by modeling
	- Apparent reason: parasite consumes glucose and produces lactate, but is it true?
	- Another cause: parasites change RBC shape and clog blood vessels, blocking glucose transport to organs and leading to higher lactate production.

## Make a model of glycolysis

- Same workflow as [Bottom-up, reproducible modeling workflow](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/11.%20VU%20BMBN%20Biotech%20Application.md#Bottom-up,%20reproducible%20modeling%20workflow)
- Controlled lysis of red blood cell but not the parasite
- Parasite-infected RBC has 100x times more glycolysis flux, suggesting an alternative control mechanism
	- More glucose transporter
	- or a glucose transporter with higher capacity
	- or enlarged RBC that can carry more glucose

### Characterizing individual reaction steps

1. Characterizing hexokinase: get the **rate equation**
	1. Include the effect of product inhibition
	2. Fit parameters of rate equation using experimental data
	3. Obtain standard errors of parameters

### Data management

- Data hosted on [FAIRDOM](http://fairdomhub.org/projects/17)
- SOP for experiment
- Experiment data

## Model validation in intact parasite

- Compare experimental data to model prediction

## Model analysis for drug target identification

- Effect of competitive inhibitor on enzyme activity in the parasite
- Investigate how much flux at [steady state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^c2a80f) change after adding a competitive inhibitor
	- a theoretical investigation using a virtual inhibitor
	- $\frac{i}{K_{i}}$: binding strength of the inhibitor; the higher the stronger the inhibition
	- dots: how much activity must be inhibited to bring down the pathway flux by 50%
	- which enzyme needs to be _least_ inhibited to bring the pathway flux down by 50%

## Metabolic control analysis

### Control coefficient

$$
C_{v_{i_{p}}}^{J_{p}}=\frac{\frac{dJ}{J}}{\frac{dv_{i}}{v_{i}}}
$$

- $J$: flux
- $v$: enzyme reaction rate
- $p$: of the parasite
- how much flux changes in response to enzyme activity change
- ratio between _percentage steady state flux change_  and _percentage enzyme activity change_ 
- The equation is normalized: sum of control coefficients for all enzymes in the pathway equal to 1
- Consider the reaction: $S\overset{v_{1}}\leftrightharpoons X \overset{v_{2}}\leftrightharpoons P$
	- If $v_{1}$ has higher control coefficient than $v_{2}$, then enzyme 1 influences the flux more. When $v_{1}$ changes, $v_{2}$ follows, but when $v_{2}$ changes, $v_{1}$ follows less.
	- In analogy, $v_{1}$ is a dictator.
	- The the rise in $v_{1}$ is eventually balanced by $v_{2}$, leading to steady state again, and net change in X concentration is 0: $$C_{v_{1}}^x+C_{v_{2}}^x=0$$
	- When $v_{1}$ and $v_{2}$ both increase by for example 5%, the flux increases by the same percent: $$C_{v_{1}}^J+C_{v_{2}}^J=1$$
- Need the whole pathway to determine

### Elasticity coefficient

$$
\epsilon_{p}^{v_{i}}=\frac{\frac{dv_{i}}{v_{i}}}{\frac{dp}{p}}
$$

- $v$: enzyme activity
- $p$: some parameter
- Enzyme activity change in response to a parameter change
- Can be determined by isolating the enzyme
- $CE=I$
	- Inverting the Elasticity coefficient matrix gives the Control coefficient matrix
	- [Inverse matrices](Linear%20Algebra/Introduction%20to%20Linear%20Algebra/3.%20Multiplication%20and%20Inverse%20Matrices.md#Inverse%20matrices)

### Response coefficient

$$
R_{\text{drug}}^{J_{p}}=\epsilon_{\text{drug}}^{v_{i_{p}}}\cdot C_{v_{i_{p}}}^{J_{p}}
$$

- how much flux changes in response to drug use

### Experimental

- Measure percent enzyme activity change vs. inhibitor concentration
- Measure percent lactate flux change vs. inhibitor concentration
- Can also change transporter concentration or other relevant enzymes
- Use lactate flux to represent pathway flux - lactate is the final product; also helps investigate lactate acidosis

## Model validation in infected RBC

- Measure extracellular glucose and lactate (M) vs. time
	- extracellular glucose decrease over time
	- extracellular lactate increase over time
- Measure lactate flux vs. external glucose
	- lactate flux increases as external glucose increases
- Measure lactate flux vs. percent infected
	- higher percent infected leads to higher lactate flux
- Data aligns with model prediction to some extent

### Cytochalasin B 

- Inhibits glucose transporter
- Inhibits lactate flux in infected RBC
- No change in lactate flux in normal RBC
- Model predictions aligns with experimental data

### Control of GAPDH in iRBC and P.f.

- Relative lactate flux to relative GAPDH activity

## P. falciparum blood stages

- Measures lactate concentration vs. Time (hours)
- Parasite has different life cycles, leading to a piece-wise change in lactate concentration
- Parasite can exit a RBC and try to invade other RBCs, some also re-invade an invaded RBC, forming a curve with 2 pieces
	- Ratio of the slopes of the 2 pieces tells how much percentage of re-invasion happens
- Higher lactate concentration in later life stages of the parasite. This is due to the parasite growing larger, but the activity per gram parasite remains the same.

## Whole body metabolism

[Paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002272)

The **whole-body model** and the **enzyme kinetics model** are interconnected components designed to simulate metabolic processes at different scales. Here's how each part is built and how they are connected:

### Whole-Body Model

1. **Structure**: 
   - The whole-body model represents the organism as a system of interconnected compartments, such as the liver, muscle, fat, and blood. Each compartment corresponds to a specific organ or tissue with distinct metabolic roles.
   - Blood acts as a transport medium, connecting these compartments and facilitating the exchange of metabolites like glucose, fatty acids, and ketones.

2. **Processes Included**:
   - The liver compartment includes detailed pathways like glycogenolysis, glycogenesis, gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle.
   - Other compartments, such as muscle and fat, contribute processes like lactate production (Cori cycle) and lipolysis.

3. **Regulation**:
   - Hormonal signals (e.g., insulin and glucagon) regulate the transitions between fed and fasting states. These hormones influence metabolic pathways by altering enzyme activities and metabolite fluxes.

4. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - The model uses differential equations to describe the dynamics of metabolite concentrations and fluxes between compartments. Parameters are derived from experimental data to ensure physiological relevance.

### Enzyme Kinetics Model

1. **Structure**:
   - The enzyme kinetics model focuses on the molecular level, describing the behavior of individual enzymes involved in metabolic pathways.
   - It uses **Michaelis-Menten kinetics** to model reaction rates, incorporating parameters like substrate affinity (Km) and maximum reaction velocity (Vmax).

2. **Regulation**:
   - Enzyme activities are modulated by factors such as allosteric regulation, covalent modification (e.g., phosphorylation), and substrate/product concentrations.
   - Feedback and feedforward loops are included to capture the dynamic regulation of metabolic pathways.

3. **Mathematical Framework**:
   - The model employs rate equations to calculate reaction velocities based on enzyme kinetics. These equations are integrated into the larger metabolic network.

### Connection Between the Models

1. **Integration**:
   - The enzyme kinetics model is embedded within the whole-body model to provide detailed descriptions of key metabolic reactions.
   - For example, the glycogen circuitry in the liver (whole-body model) incorporates enzyme kinetics for glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase.

2. **Feedback Loops**:
   - The whole-body model provides inputs like metabolite concentrations and hormonal signals to the enzyme kinetics model.
   - In turn, the enzyme kinetics model calculates reaction rates, which influence metabolite fluxes and concentrations in the whole-body model.

3. **Dynamic Interplay**:
   - The models work together to simulate physiological responses, such as the transition from fed to fasting states. The enzyme kinetics model captures the molecular mechanisms, while the whole-body model contextualizes these processes within the organism.

## Epidemiology

[Review paper](https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1475-2875-10-202#Tab3)

Whole-body metabolism and enzyme kinetics play a significant role in understanding malaria epidemiology by bridging the gap between individual host-pathogen interactions and population-level disease dynamics. Here's how they fit into the study:

### Whole-Body Metabolism

1. **Host-Pathogen Interaction**: Whole-body metabolic models help analyze how malaria parasites alter host metabolism, such as glucose homeostasis, to support their survival and proliferation. For example, malaria-infected red blood cells exhibit increased glycolysis, which can lead to systemic effects like hypoglycemia.
2. **Disease Progression**: By modeling metabolic changes across organs (e.g., liver, blood), researchers can predict how the disease progresses in different physiological states, such as fasting or feeding.
3. **Drug Targeting**: Whole-body models can identify metabolic pathways critical for parasite survival, aiding in the development of targeted therapies.

### Enzyme Kinetics

1. **Molecular Mechanisms**: Enzyme kinetics models provide insights into the biochemical reactions driving parasite metabolism, such as the glycolytic pathway in Plasmodium falciparum.
2. **Drug Development**: By simulating enzyme activity under different conditions, these models help identify potential drug targets, such as enzymes essential for parasite survival.
3. **Integration with Epidemiology**: Enzyme kinetics data can be incorporated into larger epidemiological models to predict how interventions at the molecular level (e.g., enzyme inhibitors) impact disease transmission and prevalence.

### Connection to Epidemiology

- **Transmission Dynamics**: Metabolic and kinetic models inform epidemiological studies by linking individual-level processes (e.g., parasite replication) to population-level outcomes (e.g., infection rates).
- **Predictive Modeling**: Combining these models with epidemiological data allows for more accurate predictions of disease spread and the impact of interventions.
- **Personalized Medicine**: Insights from metabolism and enzyme kinetics can guide treatment strategies tailored to individual metabolic profiles, improving outcomes and reducing transmission.

In summary, whole-body metabolism and enzyme kinetics provide a mechanistic foundation for understanding malaria's impact on the host and developing effective interventions, which are crucial for epidemiological studies and disease control efforts.
