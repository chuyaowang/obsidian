## Galactose metabolism in baker's yeast S. cerevisiae

- Everything used in the network is made by the network
- What reactions are missing from the network
	- transcription, translation, protein degradation, volume growth
	- the relation between galactose uptake and _volume growth_: when the volume grows, the cell needs to make more things, so it needs to intake more galactose
- concentration change can be due to volume growth or synthesis of more molecules
- metabolites regulate gene expression regulates enzyme levels, and enzyme levels regulate metabolism levels, which forms a loop and network
	- integration of metabolomics and proteomics

## Reactions

### Galactose entrance

- Galactose entrance via permease: $\mathrm{Gal_o}\leftrightharpoons \mathrm{Gal_i}$
- $$v=\frac{k^+_{cat}\cdot e_{T}\frac{gal_{o}}{K_{gal_{o}}}\left( 1-\frac{gal_{i}}{gal_{o}\cdot K_{eq}} \right)}{1+\frac{gal_{o}}{K_{gal_{o}}}+\frac{gal_{i}}{K_{gal_{i}}}}$$
- bottom: binding equation
- $e_T$: total enzyme
- $gal_i$ regulates gene expression indirectly, and gene expression regulates total enzyme concentration. The total enzyme concentration determines how much $gal_i$ gets in.
- monomeric enzyme

### Galactokinase

- $A+B\leftrightharpoons P+Q$
- Rapid equilibrium assumption: assuming binding reactions reach equilibrium very fast, $v=0$

## Outside control

- The system is partially controlled by its outside in addition to the extracellular galactose concentration
	- metabolism determines the 'pull' on the intake of galactose
	- more metabolism means a stronger drive to use more galactose -> more galactose input
- The green protein (gal4p) is made from outside the system (not outside the cell). Need it to activate the whole system

### Glucose repression

- Glucose repression: Since a yeast cell grows faster on glucose than on galactose, it prefers glucose over galactose if both are present. It achieves this presence by controlling the expression the activating transcription factor (the green protein, gal4p) by glucose. 
- When glucose is present, gal4p expression is _repressed_. Since gal4p forms an activating complex, its reduction reduces the enzymes for galactose metabolism
- At the same time, there is gal80p, which forms a inhibiting complex with gal4p.
- So it comes down to a balance between gal4p and gal80p. When there are more gal4p, there is more activation. When there is less gal4p (due to glucose), there is more inhibition.

> [!info]- Glucose repression in more details
> The presence of glucose regulates the transcription factor Gal4p and galactose metabolism through a process called **glucose repression**, which is a key regulatory mechanism in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (baker's yeast). Here's how it works:
> 
> 1. **Glucose Repression of GAL Genes**:
>    - When glucose is present, the GAL genes (responsible for galactose metabolism) are repressed. This repression is mediated by the transcription factor **Mig1p**, which binds to the promoters of GAL genes and inhibits their transcription.
>    - As a result, the production of Gal4p, the transcriptional activator of GAL genes, is indirectly suppressed because the GAL genes remain inactive.
> 
> 1. **Role of Gal4p in Galactose Metabolism**:
>    - Gal4p is a transcription factor that activates the expression of GAL genes, including **GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10**, which encode enzymes of the Leloir pathway. These enzymes are essential for converting galactose into glucose-6-phosphate, a metabolically useful form.
>    - In the absence of glucose and the presence of galactose, Gal4p is activated. This occurs because the repressor protein **Gal80p**, which inhibits Gal4p, is sequestered by **Gal3p** in a galactose-dependent manner. This allows Gal4p to activate GAL gene transcription.
> 
> 1. **Glucose's Dominance**:
>    - When both glucose and galactose are present, glucose repression dominates. This ensures that the cell prioritizes glucose, a more efficient energy source, over galactose. The GAL genes remain repressed, and galactose metabolism is effectively shut down.
> 
> In summary, glucose presence suppresses the activity of Gal4p and galactose metabolism by repressing GAL gene transcription through Mig1p. This regulatory mechanism allows yeast cells to preferentially utilize glucose when it is available. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific aspect!

## How to make a working model of the system

### Design specification

![[Media/10. VU BMBN A Self Regulating Metabolism Model 2025-03-19 09.59.38.excalidraw]]

- cell needs to allocate resource between metabolism and growth
- **Design specification**: maximize metabolism (glycolysis) while minimizing protein usage

### System at the optimal state

![[Media/10. VU BMBN A Self Regulating Metabolism Model 2025-03-19 11.54.09.excalidraw]]

- From the design specification, we know the optimal enzyme levels that lead to glycolysis: permease, galactokinase, gal10p, gal7p.
	- Optimal enzyme levels meaning just right amount to be sufficient for the reactions and not too many such that they are not used and not too few that it is not enough for the reactions.
	- The curve represents the optimal enzyme level for each galactose level
- The enzymes are produced by the transcription regulation part of the network.
- Assuming variable extracellular galactose concentration and fixed glucose concentration, what kinetics parameters of the reaction network produces these enzyme levels?
- Obtain parameters by fitting enzyme level vs. extracellular galactose concentration curves.

### What happens when there are more extracellular galactose

![[Media/10. VU BMBN A Self Regulating Metabolism Model 2025-03-19 10.20.38.excalidraw]]
- growth rate increases when gal_e increases
- gal_i increases with increasing gal_e, but gal_i cannot be higher than gal_e, otherwise there is outward flux
- expectation: all enzymes increase when extracellular galactose increases

> [!note]- The hyperbolic curve is characteristic of Michaelis-Menten kinetics
> ### 1. Hyperbolic vs. Sigmoidal Kinetics
> 
> - **Hyperbolic Curve**: A **Michaelis-Menten-like** response, indicating **non-cooperative** binding.
> - **Sigmoidal Curve**: A hallmark of **cooperativity**, which arises in **multimeric** enzymes with allosteric interactions between subunits.
> 
> If an enzyme-catalyzed reaction:
> 
> $$
> 2M \leftrightharpoons M_2
> $$
> 
> exhibits a **hyperbolic** rate increase with activator concentration, meaning the activator **binds independently** rather than inducing cooperative interactions.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 2. Why Non-Cooperative Enzymes Show Hyperbolic Curves
> 
> For an enzyme with a **single binding site** (or independent sites), the fraction of bound enzyme follows a **simple saturation equation**, like:
> 
> $$
> \theta = \frac{[A]}{K_A + [A]}
> $$
> 
> where:
> - $\theta$ is the fraction of enzyme bound to activator,
> - $[A]$ is the activator concentration,
> - $K_A$ is the dissociation constant of the activator.
> 
> This equation produces a **hyperbolic** response.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### 3. Why Cooperative (Multimeric) Enzymes Show Sigmoidal Curves
> 
> - **Multimeric enzymes** often exhibit **cooperative binding**, where binding of the activator to one subunit **increases the affinity** of the remaining subunits for the activator.
> - This follows the **Hill equation**:
> 
>   $$
>   \theta = \frac{[A]^n}{K_A^n + [A]^n}
>   $$
> 
>   where $n$ (the Hill coefficient) represents the degree of cooperativity.
> 
> - A **higher Hill coefficient** leads to a **sigmoidal curve** instead of a hyperbolic one.
> 
> Thus, if your enzyme were **multimeric and cooperative**, the rate would **increase slowly at low activator concentrations** (due to low initial binding affinity), then accelerate **sharply** as more activator binds, forming an **S-shaped (sigmoidal) curve**. Since this **does not** happen, the enzyme likely lacks cooperative interactions.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> - The **hyperbolic** rate curve means the enzyme follows **Michaelis-Menten-like kinetics**.
> - This suggests that the activator binds **independently**, without cooperative effects.
> - Since **cooperativity typically arises in multimeric enzymes**, the absence of cooperativity implies the enzyme is **not multimeric** (or at least does not exhibit cooperative interactions between its subunits).

- For multimeric enzymes, the curve is sigmoidal. This shows they are more sensitive to outside change.

### Dynamic response to extracellular galactose

- Gal_e fluctuates
- Expectation: enzyme concentration fluctuates with Gal_e
- Design experiments to verify
- Strong glucose repression: takes a long time to start galactose metabolism because it needs to make the permease first.
	- wild strains anticipate galactose presence when it is not by keeping galactose metabolism on at a low level
	- also the permease synthesis reaction can start by chance without anything activating the reaction, although the chance is low, since protein binding is probabilistic in nature

## Observed behavior

- steady-state metabolic flux increases with external galactose
- dependency of the growth rate of a yeast cell on the glucose concentration: _hyperbolic_ relation
- Cell balances between extracellular supply, internal need, growth, and making enzymes for metabolism. In nature, natural selection drives the optimization.

## Integration of metabolomics, proteomics, and fluxomics

- Metabolites, proteins, and flux measurements
- did we achieve this just now with our mathematical model for such data for the galactose pathway in yeast?
- do you think that pure statistics based methods, e.g. as taught in BDA and Statistics with R, or based on machine learning can achieve the same insight? These methods omit _mechanistic constraints_ entirely.
