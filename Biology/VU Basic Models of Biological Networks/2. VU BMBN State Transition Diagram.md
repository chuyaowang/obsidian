## Network

A cell has a complex network of reactions:
- transporter
- enzymes catalysing reactions  
- small molecules as reactants  
- small molecule â€“ protein binding  
- protein-protein complex formation  
- DNA-protein complex formation  
- transcription  
- translation

## A transporter protein

- Permease opens and closes to transport protein outside and inside the cell
- State transition diagram
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020250206134509.png)
	- Protein in cell ($A_{i}$)
	- Protein out of cell ($A_{o}$)
	- Enzyme open to outside ($E_{o}$)
	- Enzyme open to inside ($E_{i}$)
	- Enzyme open to outside and protein is outside ($E_oA_o$)
	- Enzyme open to inside and protein is inside ($E_iA_i$)

### Exercise: state transition diagram of protein independent membrane transport

## State transitions are reactions

- The state transition diagram can be written as reactions
- Protein conformation change reaction
	- Does not change the protein, only change its conformation
	- Defined as a reaction for modeling
- Some are biochemical reactions: molecules combine
	- $E_o+A_o\leftrightarrow E_oA_o$
	- $E_oA_o \leftrightarrow E_iA_i$
	- $E_iA_i\leftrightarrow E_i + A_i$
	- $E_i \leftrightarrow E_o$
- Location transition: molecule changes location
- Consumption: wolf eats sheep
- Production: sheep makes baby sheep
- (Dis)appearance, removal/addition

### Net processes

- Use a net process to abstract from a complex set of mechanisms
- [Transcription Factor](Transcription%20Factor.md) binding
	- Net process: TF bind and unbind, transitions from inactivated gene to activated and back
	- Complex mechanism: small molecule binds to monomer, monomer forms dimer, small molecule unbind from monomer, etc.
- The kinetics of the net process can sometimes be derived from the state transition diagram; other times it needs to be measured
	- When the kinetics of the state transition diagram are all known, it can be derived. This is the case for molecular interaction networks.
	- When the underlying state transition diagram is too complex: too many reactions and kinetics, like when a wolf eats a sheep, the rate of a wolf eating a sheep needs to be measured.

## Examples of state transition diagram

- TF dimerization, signal binding, conformational change, DNA binding
- TF dimerization, phosphorylation and dephosphorylation by dedicated enzymes (**catalysts** required), conformational change, DNA binding
- Two substrates and two products enzyme mechanism: protein phosphorylation
	- substrates: unphosphorylated protein, ATP
	- products: phosphorylated protein, ADP (phosphate given to protein)
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020250206143701.png)
	- random mechanism: S1 and S2 binds to the enzyme randomly; P1 and P2 unbind randomly
	- ordered mechanism: S1 or S2 first binds followed by the other one; P1 or P2 first unbinds followed by the other one
	- Experiments are done to determine which mechanism. If the random mechanism is eliminated ($ES_n$ formation is 0), it is ordered mechanism.
- Protein dephosphorylation: 1 substrate and two products
	- substrate: phosphorylated protein
	- product: protein and phosphate
- TF phosphorylation and DNA binding
- Cancer pathway
	- Important for **drug development**
	- Membrane receptor dimerization, ligand (growth factor) binding, autophosphorylation
	- downstream signaling from EFG receptor, binding of adaptor proteins
	- downstream signaling from EFG receptor continued, activation of MAPK pathway
		- Kinetics of growth rate with respect to signal
		- The shape of the curve reflects whether growth rate is uncontrolled (cancer or not)
		- Drugs reverts the curve to the shape corresponding to the healthy situation
		- **Personalized medicine**: drug design that most effectively reverts the curve for each patient using their genome data
			- easier when early and mutations are fewer; when metastases happen the mutations become complex
		- Why combination of drugs: cancer is caused by a combination of mutations
