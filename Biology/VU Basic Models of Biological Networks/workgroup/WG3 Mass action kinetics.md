# WG3 Mass action kinetics

## p36 Q1

### 1. why decrease

s forms dimers over time, and p become bound to the dimers over time. The reactions will reverse when there are few s and p present. A steady state is formed at this critical concentration of s and p.

### 2. longer time

the net reaction rates become 0, and the concentration becomes constant.

### 3. explain the 2's

1. Conservation of mass
2. It takes 2 ligands for the TF to be activated
3. It takes 2 monomers to form a dimer

### 4. why does s not drop to 0

there are ligands already bound and they become unbound when the forward reaction rate becomes 0 when the free ligands are all removed
