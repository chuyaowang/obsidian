## Metabolic model

[Genome Scaled Metabolic Model](LCMS/Genome%20Scaled%20Metabolic%20Model.md)

- Where to begin: identify an isolated pathway

### Bottom-up, reproducible modeling workflow

- Approaches
	- Bottom up: from reactions
	- Top down: from data fit equations
- Bottom up steps
	- Model construction
		- from enzyme kinetics
	- Model validation
		- evaluate model on validation data
	- Model analysis
		- sensitivity analysis
		- control analysis
	- Model application
		- A model is a tool. What is it supposed to do?
	- Data management

## Model construction

- Define the system:
	- boundaries: external variables of the model
		- substrate and products are considered fixed
	- components
	- variables
		- product and substrates of individual enzymes

- Weimberg pathway
	- $\text{NAD}\rightarrow \text{NADH}^+$: reduction of $\text{NAD}$
	- 5 enzymes in total: XDH, XLA, XAD, KDXD, KGSADH

### Characterization of enzymes

- Enzyme isolation/purification
- Recombinant expression

### Model construction I: initial rate kinetics

- $S\leftrightharpoons P$
- ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312094038.png)
- Fit absorbance (product concentration) vs. time
	- higher slope shows higher activity (production rate)
- As substrate concentration goes higher, the slope becomes higher
- Described by a hyperbolic curve: $v$ as a function of substrate or product concentration $$v=\frac{V_M\cdot\frac{S}{K_{S}}}{1+\frac{S}{K_{S}}}$$
- With **rate equations**, can define **ODEs**, for some **initial values**, the **concentration over time** function can be solved numerically.

### Model construction II: progress curve

- Product formation during the reaction will inhibit the forward reaction: $$v=\frac{V_M\cdot\frac{S}{K_{S}}}{1+\frac{S}{K_{S}}+\frac{P}{K_{P}}}$$
- Without including product formation inhibiting the forward reaction: overestimation of product formation: ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312095050.png)
- Adding product at the beginning of reaction brings down the reaction rate. Adding more brings down more.
	- ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312095453.png)
	- get product sensitivity ($K_P$)
- With accounting for product inhibition (solid lines): ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312101241.png)
	- dashed: without accounting for product inhibition

### Model construction III: parameterized rate equation

- Rate equation: $$v\mathrm{XDH}=\frac{V^{M}_{\mathrm{XDH}}\frac{\mathrm{NAD}^{+}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHNAD}^{+}}}\frac{\mathrm{XYL}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHXYL}}}}{\left(1+\frac{\mathrm{NAD}^{+}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHNAD}^{+}}}+\frac{\mathrm{NADH}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHNADH}}}\right)\left(1+\frac{\mathrm{XYL}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHXYL}}}+\frac{\mathrm{XLAC}}{K_{\mathrm{XDHXLAC}}}\right)}$$
- Parameter estimation has a standard error
- Identifiability issue: ?

### Model construction and validation

- Sequential pathway reconstruction: add enzymes sequentially 
- compare with predicted curve

### Model construction IV: "One-pot" incubation

- Accounts for allosteric control: $$v=\frac{V_M\cdot\frac{S}{K_{S}}}{1+\frac{S}{K_{S}}+\frac{P}{K_{P}}+\frac{I}{K_{I}}}$$
- Add all enzyme together: ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312102529.png)

> After model construction, the parameters are determined

## Model validation

- Test model in its predictive strength for new experiments
- confidence intervals: 
	- monte carlo simulation to obtain
	- measurement error of model parameters give rise to errors

### One pot conversions with perturbations

- Take one reaction out, then compare experimental data with model prediction
- ![](Media/Pasted%20image%2020250312103308.png)
- XLA deletion: XLAC concentration changes more slowly since the enzyme is gone
	- interestingly, the product (KG) formation rate did not change much
- NAD recycling: add pyruvate and lactate dehydrogenase to recycle NAD

## Model analysis

### one pot conversions - optimization

- more enzymes lead to higher reaction rate
- how much faster can we make the reactions be

## Model application

- Modeling building and validation were in incubation environment
- In production environment, the environment is much more complex
- Over-express the enzyme to get higher reaction rates in real organism
- Can we simulate the production process

### Cell-free extract conversions

- Raise cells and test model on data from cell free extracts

## Data management

- Make all data and model available, use standard formats, show how to reproduce simulation results.
- [**JWS online**](https://jjj.bio.vu.nl/): Model repository and web based simulator
- Use SED-ML links to reproduce simulation results
- [FAIRDOMHub](https://fairdomhub.org/) : data management platform

## Summary

- Constructed a quantitative mechanistic model for the pathway - 
	- initial rate kinetics: substrate sensitivity, product sensitivity, reversibility
	- substrate conversions
	- one pot cascades: check for allosteric interaction
- Model validated with perturbation experiments
- Model applied for optimization and cell free extract conversions
- Key steps in the pathway are the XAD and KGSADH
	- for metabolic engineering
