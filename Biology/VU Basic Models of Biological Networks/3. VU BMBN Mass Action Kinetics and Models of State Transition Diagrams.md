[0. VU BMBN](0.%20VU%20BMBN.md)

## Mathematical model of state transition diagrams

- modeling state transition diagram with _mass action kinetics_
- start with modeling _reactions_, but state transition diagrams and their modeling are more applicable in more [scenarios](1.%20VU%20BMBN%20Mathematical%20modeling.md#Complexities%20in%20nature)
- concentration of states will change due to reactions, leading to dynamics
- the model of the state transition diagram will be _deterministic_ and predict the the _change in time_ of the concentration of the states ($\frac{da}{dt}$)

### Conventions

- **Name**: capital letters, A
- **Concentration**: lower-case, a

### To do

- become familiar with _mass action kinetics_ (chemical kinetics) describing the rate of state transition in terms of kinetic parameters and concentrations  
- become familiar with rate of concentration change equations (_differential equations_) expressed in terms of mass action kinetics  
- numerically solve the resulting differential equation, given initial concentrations and parameter values to obtain a time series

## Mass action kinetics 

- Mass action kinetics express the rate of reactions in terms of kinetics parameters and concentration of reactants
- examples: reactions, reaction rate equations according to principles of mass-action kinetics
	- Isomerization reaction: $A\overset{1}{\rightleftharpoons} B$, $v_1 = k_1^+ \times a - k_1^- \times b$
	- Complex formation reaction: $A+B\overset{2}{\rightleftharpoons} AB$, $v_2 = k_2^+ \times a \times b - k_1^- \times ab$
	- Dimer formation reaction: $A+A\overset{3}{\rightleftharpoons} A_2$, $v_3 = k_3^+ \times a^2 - k_3^- \times a_2$
	- Conversion reaction:  $A+B\overset{4}{\rightleftharpoons} C+D$, $v_4 = k_4^+ \times a \times b - k_4^- \times c \times d$
	- Conversion reaction:  $3A\overset{5}{\rightleftharpoons} 2B$, $v_5 = k_5^+ \times a^3 - k_5^- \times b^2$
- $v$: reaction rates
- $k$: rate constants
- $a, b, etc.$: concentrations

## Principle of mass action kinetics

- $$\begin{aligned}&\sum_{i=1}^{k}m_i^+S_i\rightleftharpoons\sum_{j=1}^{l}n_j^-P_j\\&v=k^+\prod_{i=1}^ks_i^{m_i}-k^-\prod_{j=1}^lp_j^{n_j}\end{aligned}$$
- Why multiplicative: the effect of concentration on reaction rate is multiplicative
	- $A+B\rightleftharpoons AB$
	- If I have 2 A and 2 B molecules, there are $2\times 2=4$ ways they can collide and make reaction happen
- For **spontaneous** reactions, not for those that involve enzymes
- Spontaneous reactions with more than 3 reactants or products are rare

## Rate of change in concentrations due to reactions

### Example: Isomerization reaction

- $A\overset{1}{\rightleftharpoons} B$
- $v1 = k_1^+a-k_1^-b$
	- if $b=0$ then $v1> 0$, $B$ is made from $A$
	- if $a=0$ then $v1<0$, A is made from $B$ 
	- $a$ and $b$ cannot be less than 0, meaning negative concentrations
- $\frac{da}{dt}=-v_1$; $\frac{db}{dt}=v_1$
	- per reaction event 1 $a$ molecule is lost and 1 $b$ molecule is created (Explained more in [Building a stoichiometric model](4.%20VU%20ISB%20Stoichiometric%20Models%20of%20Metabolism.md#Building%20a%20stoichiometric%20model) and [Rates of change in concentration](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Rates%20of%20change%20in%20concentration))
- $\frac{da}{dt}+\frac{db}{dt}=0$
	- the total number of molecules is conserved - conservation of mass
- Ordinary differential equations
	- Deterministic: with absolute certainty
	- Memoryless: next state ($t+\Delta t$) depends only on the current state ($t$), not past states (**Markov process**)

### Example: Dimer formation

- $2A\rightleftharpoons A_2$, $v = k^+a^2-k^-a_2$
- $\frac{da}{dt}=-2v$; $\frac{da_2}{dt}=1v$
- $\frac{da}{dt} + 2\frac{da_2}{dt} = 0$
	- total number of A is conserved

### Exercise

- $2A\rightleftharpoons3B+C$
- $v = k^+a^2-k^-b^3c$
- $\frac{da}{dt}=-2v$; $\frac{db}{dt}=3v$; $\frac{dc}{dt}=v$
- write later, see ipad notes

## Solving the differential equation

- The differential equations can be solved numerically. See WG2 and [WG4 Belousov Zhabotinsky Reaction](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/workgroup/WG4%20Belousov%20Zhabotinsky%20Reaction.md)
- Solving for $a(t+2\Delta t)$ from $a(t+\Delta t)$ and its derivative at $t+\Delta t$: $$a(t+\Delta t)+\frac{da(t+\Delta t)}{dt}\Delta t=a(t+2\Delta t)$$
- LSODA: python solver for ordinary differential equations.

## Units

- $v$ is in the unit of $\frac{concentration}{time}$
- the units of $k$ needs to be change accordingly to make the overall unit $\frac{concentration}{time}$

### Example

-  $2A\rightleftharpoons A_2$, $v = k^+a^2-k^-a_2$
- $a$ and $a_2$ are concentrations
- $k^+: \frac{1}{conc*time}$, $k^-: \frac{1}{time}$

## Make a model

- Convention: clock-wise reaction is positive
- Give:
	- reactions
	- their rate equations
	- the rate of concentration change equations (differential equations) of all molecular species
- **Reactions**: $$\begin{aligned}M+M&\leftrightharpoons M_2\\M_2+X&\leftrightharpoons XM_2\\M_2X&\leftrightharpoons M_2 + X\\XM_2X&\leftrightharpoons M_2X+X\\XM_2+X&\leftrightharpoons XM_2X\\\end{aligned}$$
- **Rate equations**: $$\begin{aligned}v_1&=k_1^+\cdot m^2-k_1^-\cdot m_2\\v_2&=k_2^+\cdot m_2\cdot x-k_2^-\cdot xm_2\\v_3&=k_3^+\cdot m_2x-k_3^-\cdot m_2\cdot x\\v_4&=k_4^+\cdot xm_2x-k_4^-\cdot m_2x\cdot x\\v_5&=k_5^+\cdot xm_2\cdot x-k_5^-\cdot xm_2x\\\end{aligned}$$
- **Differential equations**: $$\begin{aligned}\frac{dx}{dt}&=-v_2+v_3+v_4-v_5\\\frac{dm}{dt}&=-2v_1\\\frac{dm_2}{dt}&=v_1-v_2+v_3\\\frac{dxm_2}{dt}&=v_2-v_5\\\frac{dm_2x}{dt}&=-v_3+v_4\\\frac{dxm_2x}{dt}&=-v_4+v_5\\\end{aligned}$$

## Dynamics of a simpler model

- Initial values are needed for simulation
- Equation: $2M\rightleftharpoons M_2$
- Model
	-  $v = k^+m^2-k^-m_2$
	- $\frac{dm_2}{dt}=v$: rate at which $M_2$ is formed
	- $\frac{dm}{dt}=-2v$: rate at which $M$ is consumed
- Plot $\frac{dm_2}{dt}$ as a function of $m^2$: $\frac{dm_2}{dt}$ reaches 0, meaning it reaches a [Stationary state](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Stationary%20state)
	- For $m_{tot}$ both above and below, $\frac{dm_2}{dt}$ is "attracted" to the stationary state.
	- True for all $k$

## With the small molecule added

- Once the small molecule is removed, it concentration immediately drops to 0. Then the binding reaction of the small molecule and the dimer can only occur in reverse. So the small molecule concentration rises again.
- Once there are some small molecules released into the solution again, the binding reaction can occur again, and the system reaches another equilibrium
