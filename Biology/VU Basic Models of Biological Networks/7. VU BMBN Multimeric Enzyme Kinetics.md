## This week

- Multimeric enzyme
- Conformational change
	- relaxed state: active; high affinity
	- tense state: usually inactive; low affinity
	- effectors (activators and inhibitors) **shifts** enzymes between its relaxed and tense state
	- binding of effector on one subunit makes other subunits more prone to binding
- _Conformation-dependent_ reactant and effector affinities (dissociation constants)

## Regulatory proteins are generally composed on multiple subunits

- Regulatory proteins
	- Signaling and gene expression: transcription factors, membrane receptor proteins
	- Regulatory metabolic enzymes: subject to negative and positive feedback regulation
- $v=V_{max}(\frac{\frac{S}{K}}{1+\frac{S}{K_S}})^n$
- by changing the parameter $n$ (number of subunits), the rate of enzymatic reaction vs. product or inhibitor concentration curve changes shape
- more subunits makes the curve change faster in response to concentration change -> sensitizing the enzyme to reactants or effectors

## Cooperative subunits: reactant or effector (de)sensitization

- Effectors change enzymes between relaxed (R) state and tense (T) state in a _conformational change reaction_
- Relaxed state has either _higher affinity_ for reactants or _higher catalytic activity_ or _both_.
- **Sequential** model of conformational change: subunits change conformations sequentially
- **Concerted** model of conformational change: change at the same time; easier one
- Binding polynomials for the T state and the R state; the parameters are different between the two.
- Binding polynomials for the binding sites on the subuni

### Conformational equilibrium constant

![[Media/7. VU BMBN Multimeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-02-26 09.54.40.excalidraw]]
- Conformational equilibrium constant (L) when accounting for only _spontaneous_ changes between T and R: $$L=\frac{\text{[Tensed]}}{\text{[Relaxed]}}$$
- Conformational equilibrium constant when accounting for _effector binding_: $$L=\frac{\text{[Tensed]}}{\text{[Relaxed]}}=L'\frac{1+\frac{i}{K_i}}{1+\frac{a}{K_A}}$$
#### Conceptual interpretations

- $L'$ represents the natural tendency to stay in the tensed or relaxed state
- $1+\frac{i}{K_i}$ is the binding polynomial of the inhibitor in the allosteric site. More inhibitor binding means more tensed (inactive) state, which increases $L$
- $1+\frac{a}{K_A}$ is the binding polynomial of the activator in the allosteric site. More activator binding means more relaxed (active) state, which decreases $L$
- When there is no tensed state, $[\text{Tensed}]$ is 0. $L$ is 0.

## Multimeric enzymes: binding polynomials

### Situation 1

- One subunit, two substrates two products, independent allosteric and catalytic sites, no state transitions
- [Situation 3](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Situation%203) and [Inhibitor binding at the allosteric site](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/6.%20VU%20BMBN%20Enzyme%20Kinetics%20for%20Effector%20Binding.md#Inhibitor%20binding%20at%20the%20allosteric%20site) for binding polynomial derivation

$$
\mathcal{B}=\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{C} }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K_{I}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{A} }
$$

### Situation 2

- One subunit, two substrates two products, independent allosteric and catalytic sites, state transition between T and R

$$
\mathcal{B}=\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{C_{R}} }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K_{I}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{A_{R}} }+L\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K'_{A}}+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K'_{A}K'_{B}}+\frac{p}{K'_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K'_{P}K'_{Q}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{C_{T}} }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K'_{I}} \right) }_{ \mathcal{A_{T}} }
$$

- Binding of effectors and changing of states change the dissociation constants of the reactants.
- The more tensed state there is, the more influence the binding polynomials of the tensed states have on the total binding polynomial.
- An enzyme can exist in either T or R state. So their relationship is a summation. This is similar to how the free enzyme, bound to $a$, bound to $p$ states are summed in the binding polynomial.
	- The total probability of a coin toss is P = P(head)+P(tail)
	- Mutually exclusive events sum to the total probability
	- Partition function theory: mutually exclusive states contribute additively

### Situation 3

- Two subunits, two substrates two products, independent allosteric and catalytic sites, state transition between T and R

$$
\mathcal{B}=\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}} \right)^2 }_{ (\mathcal{C_{R}})^2 }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K_{I}} \right)^2 }_{ (\mathcal{A_{R}})^2 }+L\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{a}{K'_{A}}+ \frac{a\cdot b}{K'_{A}K'_{B}}+\frac{p}{K'_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K'_{P}K'_{Q}} \right)^2 }_{ (\mathcal{C_{T})^2} }\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{i}{K'_{I}} \right)^2 }_{ (\mathcal{A_{T}})^2 }
$$

- Subunits just mean adding exponents to the binding polynomials. 
	- Two subunits - raise to power of 2
	- Four subunits - raise to power of 4
- The relationship between subunits is multiplicative rather than additive similar to how the binding polynomials of independent catalytic and allosteric sites multiply to form the total binding polynomial.
	- For two independent events $A$ and $B$, their joint probability is $P(A,B)=P(A)\times P(B)$
	- The binding polynomial represents the sum over the statistical weights of all states for that subunit. For multiple subunits, the probability of the system being in a certain combined state is the product of the probabilities for each subunit's state.

### Simplified form

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{B}&=\mathcal{(C_{R})^{2}}\mathcal{(A_{R})^{2}}+L\mathcal{(C_{T})^{2}}\mathcal{(A_{T})^{2}}\\
&=(\mathcal{A_{R}})^{2}\left( (\mathcal{C_{R}})^{2}+L\cdot \frac{(\mathcal{A_{T}})^{2}}{(\mathcal{A_{R}})^{2}}(\mathcal{C_{T}})^{2} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
## Exercise

- derive binding polynomials for
	- two subunit enzymes
	- with two conformations
	- catalyzing the reaction $S\leftrightharpoons P$ or $S\rightarrow P$, one substrate and one product
- derive the rate equation

### For the simpler case $S\rightarrow P$

![[Media/7. VU BMBN Multimeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-26 16.32.54.excalidraw]]
- Since the reaction is irreversible. Product does not bind to the enzyme again. After the reaction it immediately unbinds and exits the system.

- Binding polynomial: $$
\begin{aligned}
e_{2,T} &= r_{2}+s r_{2}+r_{2}s+r_{2}s_{2}+t_{2}+st_{2}+t_{2}s+t_{2}s_{2}\\
&=r_{2}+\frac{s\cdot r_{2}}{K_{S}}+\frac{r_{2}\cdot s}{K_{S}}+\frac{r_{2}\cdot s^{2}}{K_{S}^{2}}+t_{2}+\frac{t_{2}\cdot s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{s\cdot t_{2}}{K'_{S}}+\frac{t_{2}\cdot s^{2}}{K_{S}'^{2}}\\
&=r_{2}\left[ 1+2\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\left( \frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)^{2}+\frac{t_{2}}{s_{2}}\left( 1+2 \frac{s}{K'_{s}}+\left( \frac{s}{K'_{s}} \right)^2 \right) \right]\\
r_{2}&=e_{2,T}\cdot \frac{1}{\mathcal{B}}\\
\mathcal{B}&=\frac{e_{2,T}}{e}=\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)^2+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}\right)^2\\
L&=\frac{t_{2}}{s_{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- Note for $r_{2}s_{2}$ and $t_{2}s_{2}$, the square of $s$ and $K_{S}$ are taken because $s$ binds to the enzyme 2 times.
- Assuming T is catalytically inactive (no reaction), then the rate equation is: $$\begin{aligned}
v &= k^+r_{2}s+k^+ sr_{2}+2\cdot k^+r_{2}s_{2}\\
&=k^+ \frac{s\cdot r_{2}}{K_{S}}+k^+ \frac{s \cdot r_{2}}{K_{S}} + 2k^+\cdot r_{2} \left( \frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)^2\\
&=2k^+r_{2} \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)\\
&=\frac{2k^+e_{2,T} \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}} \right)^2+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}\right)^2}\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\mathcal{C_{R}}}{(\mathcal{C_{R}})^{2}+L(\mathcal{C_{T})^2}}
\end{aligned}
$$
### Interpretation

- $2k^+e_{2,T}$: maximal reaction rate; see [Conceptual interpretation of rate equation](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Conceptual%20interpretation%20of%20rate%20equation)
- $1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}$: binding polynomial of the relaxed state
- $1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}$: binding polynomial of the tense state
- Note the exponent of $\mathcal{C_{R}}$ is $n-1$ in the numerator, where $n$ is the number of subunits

## General form of enzyme rate equation

$$v=\frac{V_M^+\prod_i\frac{s_i}{K_i}\mathcal{C_R}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{\prod_jp_j}{\prod_is_iK_{eq}}\right)}{\mathcal{C_R}^n+L\frac{\mathcal{A_T}^n}{\mathcal{A_R}^n}\mathcal{C_T}^n},\mathrm{~}\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{C_R}^n+L\frac{\mathcal{A_T}^n}{\mathcal{A_R}^n}\mathcal{C_T}^n$$


- $n$: number of subunits
- $\mathcal{C_{R}}$: binding polynomial of the catalytic site in relaxed state
- $\mathcal{C_{T}}$: binding polynomial of the catalytic site in relaxed state
- $\mathcal{A_{R}}$: binding polynomial of the allosteric site in tense state
- $\mathcal{A_{T}}$: binding polynomial of the allosteric site in tense state
- $V_M^+$: maximum forward rate $=n\cdot k^+\cdot e_{n,T}$
	- Note that we assume no reaction in tensed state. So $k^+$ here refers to the rate coefficient of the relaxed state which happens when there is no tensed state or when an activator turns a tensed state into a relaxed state
- $K_{eq}$ of the equation; product over substrate; see [The Haldane relationship](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#The%20Haldane%20relationship)
- Why the $n-1$: one of the catalytic sites must be filled for the reaction to proceed, the other $n-1$ sites can be in any state.

## Example continued: for the more complex case $S\leftrightharpoons P$

- Since the reaction is reversible, consider product can bind to enzymes
- Binding polynomials: $$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{C_{R}}=1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}\\
\mathcal{C_{T}}=1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}}
\end{aligned}$$
- The rate equation consists of the forward and reverse rate: $$\begin{aligned}
v&=v^+ - v^-\\
&=k^+s-k^-p
\end{aligned}
$$
- Consider $n=3$; 3 subunits. Then the forward rate can be written using the [General form of enzyme rate equation](#General%20form%20of%20enzyme%20rate%20equation) as $$
v^+=\frac{3k^+e_{T} \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}}{(1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}})^{3}+L(1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}})^{3}}
$$
- And the reverse rate can be written as: $$
v^-=\frac{3k^-e_{T} \frac{p}{K_{P}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}}{(1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}})^{3}+L(1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}})^{3}}
$$
- Note how $v^+$ and $v^-$ only differ in $k^+$ vs. $k^-$ and $\frac{p}{K_{P}}$ vs. $\frac{s}{K_{S}}$
- Then $v$ is: $$
\begin{aligned}
v&=\frac{3k^+e_{T} \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}-3k^-e_{T} \frac{p}{K_{P}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}}\\
V_{M}^+&=3k^+e_{T},\quad V_{M}^-=3k^-e_{T}\\
v&=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}- V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_{P}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}}\\
v&=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}\left( 1- \frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}} \right)}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- The ratio $\frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}}$ determines the direction of the net reaction:
	- $>1$: reverse reaction dominates, $v<0$
	- $<1$: forward reaction dominates, $v>0$
