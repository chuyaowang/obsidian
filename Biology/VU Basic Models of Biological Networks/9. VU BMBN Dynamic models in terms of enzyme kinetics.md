## Oscillating systems

- glycolysis in baker's yeast

## Attractors

[Different attractor states](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Stationary%20state)
- Point attractor: steady state, equilibrium state
- periodic: ends in the same state, know the next state from the previous state
	- Limit cycle
	- Limit cycle with multiple periods
- Strange attractor
	- not periodic
	- does not cross itself

## Oscillation of cell cycle

- feedback control
- delay in the feedback allows cycles of increase and decrease to accumulate

## MAPK signaling and oscillations
