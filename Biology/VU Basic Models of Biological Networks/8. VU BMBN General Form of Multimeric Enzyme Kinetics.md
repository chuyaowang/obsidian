## Equilibrium constant interpretations

- For a reaction $S\leftrightharpoons P$, the equilibrium constant can be defined in 3 ways.

### Case 1

- In [Example continued: for the more complex case](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Example%20continued%20for%20the%20more%20complex%20case%20$S%20leftrightharpoons%20P$), we arrived at the rate equation: $$v=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}\left( 1- \frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}} \right)}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}}$$
- From the ratio $\frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}}$ we can define the equilibrium constant for the rate equation: $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}}&=\frac{p}{s}\cdot \frac{\frac{V_{M}^-}{K_{P}}}{\frac{V_{M}^+}{K_{S}}}\\
&=\frac{p}{s \frac{V_{M}^+K_{P}}{V_{M}^-K_{S}}}\\
&=\frac{p}{sK_{eq}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{V_{M}^+K_{P}}{V_{M}^-K_{S}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Case 2

- From the rate equation: $$\begin{aligned}
v&=k^+s-k^-p\\
&=k^+s\left( 1-\frac{k^-p}{k^+s} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
- Similarly, the ratio $\frac{k^-p}{k^+s}$ contains the equilibrium constant: $$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{k^-p}{k^+s}&=\frac{p}{s\cdot \frac{k^+}{k^-}}\\
&=\frac{p}{sK_{eq}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{k^+}{k^-}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Case 3

- For a monomeric enzyme, it is the same
	- See derivation at [Single substrate single product](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Single%20substrate%20single%20product)
- $$\begin{aligned}
\frac{V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_{S}}-V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_{P}}}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}&=\frac{V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1-\frac{V_{M}^- \frac{p}{K_{P}}}{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}} \right)}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1-\frac{p}{s\cdot \frac{V_{M}^+K_{P}}{V_{M}^-K_{S}}} \right)}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+\frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1-\frac{p}{s\cdot K_{eq}} \right)}{1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}}\\
K_{eq}&=\frac{V_{M}^+K_{P}}{V_{M}^-K_{S}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### Interpretation

- In all 3 cases, consider that P is the same molecule and S is also the same molecule.
- The $K_{eq}$ in all 3 cases have the same value since it is determined by the identity of S and P (it is independent of the kinetics of the spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed reaction).

> [!info]- Thermodynamics reason why the equilibrium constant has the same value
> The equilibrium constant $K_{eq}$ for the reaction $S \leftrightharpoons P$ depends **only** on the identity of the reactants (SS) and products (PP) and is **independent** of the kinetics of the reaction (whether spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed).
> 
> ### Why?
> 
> The equilibrium constant is defined thermodynamically as:
> 
> $K_{eq} = \frac{[P]_{eq}}{[S]_{eq}}$
> 
> where $[P]_{eq}$ and $[S]_{eq}$ are the equilibrium concentrations of the product and substrate, respectively.
> 
> ### Key Reasons for Independence from Kinetics
> 
> 1. Equilibrium Constant Comes from Thermodynamics, Not Kinetics
>     
>     - $K_{eq}$ is determined by the difference in **Gibbs free energy** ($\Delta G^\circ$) between $S$ and $P$, not by the reaction mechanism.
>         
>     - The relation is given by:
>         
>         $K_{eq} = e^{-\Delta G^\circ / RT}$
>         
>         where:
>         
>         - $\Delta G^\circ$ is the standard free energy change,
>         - $R$ is the gas constant,
>         - $T$ is the temperature.
>     - Since $\Delta G^\circ$ is a function of only the thermodynamic properties of $S$ and $P$, **$K_{eq}$ does not depend on how the reaction occurs, only on where it ends up at equilibrium**.
>         
> 2. **Independence from Reaction Pathway**
>     
>     - Whether the reaction occurs via a **spontaneous pathway**, an **enzyme-catalyzed pathway**, or even a **non-biological mechanism**, the equilibrium concentrations will be dictated solely by the thermodynamics of $S$ and $P$.
>     - Enzymes **affect only the rate** at which equilibrium is reached; they do not change the equilibrium concentrations themselves.
> 3. **Independence from Rate Constants**
>     
>     - For a simple reversible reaction:
>         
>          $S\underset{k_-}{\stackrel{k_+}{\leftrightharpoons}} P$
>         
>         the equilibrium constant is related to the **forward and reverse rate constants** by:
>         
>         $K_{eq} = \frac{k_+}{k_-}$
>     - While the individual rate constants ($k_+$ and $k_-$) depend on the reaction pathway (e.g., spontaneous vs. enzyme-catalyzed), their ratio remains fixed by thermodynamics.
>         
>     - Thus, whether an enzyme speeds up the reaction or not, $K_{eq}$ remains the same.
>         
> 
> ### Conclusion
> 
> - **$K_{eq}$ depends only on the thermodynamic properties of $S$ and $P$** (i.e., their free energy difference).
> - **It is independent of the reaction kinetics** (whether spontaneous or enzyme-catalyzed), because enzymes **only change the rate**, not the final equilibrium position.
> 
> This fundamental principle is why enzymes can **accelerate** reactions but **cannot alter** the equilibrium composition of reactants and products.

- $K_{eq}$ replaces the $V_m^-$ in the [General form of enzyme rate equation](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#General%20form%20of%20enzyme%20rate%20equation)
- Why we want to use [Equilibrium](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#^aca7bc) constants: they are tabulated. So no need to measure both $V_{M}^+$ and $V_{M}^-$

> [!note] The equilibrium constant definition is context dependent
> - The $K_{eq}$ is context dependent: if the reaction is written backwards, the $K_{eq}$ is inverted
> - Also see [Equilibrium constants](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/4.%20VU%20BMBN%20Models%20of%20State%20Transition%20Diagram,%20Dissociation%20Constants%20and%20Diffusion%20Limitation.md#Equilibrium%20constants), [Association and dissociation constants](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Association%20and%20dissociation%20constants), and [conceptual understanding of the equilibrium constant](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#^293c15)

## Allosteric binding site

- Add an allosteric site to [Example continued: for the more complex case $S\leftrightharpoons P$](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Example%20continued%20for%20the%20more%20complex%20case%20$S%20leftrightharpoons%20P$)
- The binding polynomials are: $$
\begin{aligned}
A_{T}&=1+\frac{x}{K_{X}}\\
A_{R}&=1+\frac{x}{K'_{X}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- $$
v=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}\overbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)^{3} }^{ (\mathcal{A_{R}})^{3} }- V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_{P}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}\overbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)^{3} }^{ (\mathcal{A_{R}})^{3} }}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)^{3} }_{ (\mathcal{A_{R}})^{3} }+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}\underbrace{ \left( 1+\frac{x}{K'_{X}} \right)^{3} }_{ (\mathcal{A_{T}})^{3} }}
$$
- The $(\mathcal{A_{R}})^{3}$ can be factored out from the above equation, and it becomes: $$
v=\frac{V_{M}^+ \frac{s}{K_{S}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}- V_{M}^-\frac{p}{K_{P}}\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{2}}{\left( 1+\frac{s}{K_{S}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}} \right)^{3}+L\left( 1+\frac{s}{K'_{S}}+\frac{p}{K'_{{P}}} \right)^{3}\underbrace{ \frac{\left( 1+\frac{x}{K'_{X}} \right)^{3}}{\left( 1+\frac{x}{K_{X}} \right)^{3}} }_{ \frac{(\mathcal{A_{T}})^{3}}{(\mathcal{A_{R}})^{3}} }}
$$, as seen in the [General form of enzyme rate equation](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/7.%20VU%20BMBN%20Multimeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#General%20form%20of%20enzyme%20rate%20equation)
- An activator stabilizes the $R$ state. An inhibitor turns the enzyme from the $R$ state into the $T$ state and stabilizes the $T$ state. Hence, for an inhibitor, the dissociation constant $K'_{X}<K_{X}$ since the inhibitor binds strongly to the T state to stabilize it.

## Exercise

$$v=\frac{V_M^+\prod_i\frac{s_i}{K_i}\mathcal{C_R}^{n-1}\left(1-\frac{\prod_jp_j}{\prod_is_iK_{eq}}\right)}{\mathcal{C_R}^n+L\frac{\mathcal{A_T}^n}{\mathcal{A_R}^n}\mathcal{C_T}^n},\mathrm{~}\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{C_R}^n+L\frac{\mathcal{A_T}^n}{\mathcal{A_R}^n}\mathcal{C_T}^n$$

### 1. Consider an enzyme without allosteric site, set n to 1, choose the affinities of T and R state are the same. What happens?

- Only catalytic site: $\mathcal{A_{T}}=\mathcal{A_{R}}=1$, $1$ is the term for the free enzyme
- One subunit: $n=1$
- No difference between T and R states: $L=0$ since $[\text{Tensed}]=0$
- This is the simplest monomeric enzyme
- The general form simplifies to $$\begin{aligned}
v&=\frac{V_M^+\prod_i\frac{s_i}{K_i}\cancel{ \mathcal{C_R}^{n-1} }\left(1-\frac{\prod_jp_j}{\prod_is_iK_{eq}}\right)}{\mathcal{C_R}\cancel{ ^n }+\cancel{ L\frac{\mathcal{A_T}^n}{\mathcal{A_R}^n}\mathcal{C_T}^n} }\\
&=\frac{V_{M}^+\prod_{i} \frac{s_{i}}{K_{S_{i}}}\left( 1- \frac{\prod_{j} p_{j}}{K_{eq}\prod_{i} s_{i}} \right)}{\mathcal{C_{R}}}
\end{aligned}$$

### 2. Consider the following mechanism for an enzyme without any allosteric site and 3 subunits. Give the rate equation

![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-23 21.04.42.excalidraw]]
- $n=3$
- $\mathcal{A_{T}}=\mathcal{A_{R}}=1$
- $L=0$
- Binding polynomials: $$
\mathcal{B}=1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{p}K_{Q}}
$$

### 3. Add an allosteric site to which an inhibitor binds. Give suitable binding polynomials for the allosteric R and T state.  

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{C_{R}}=1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{p}K_{Q}}\\
\mathcal{C_{T}}=1+\frac{a}{K'_{A}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K'_{A}K'_{B}}+\frac{p}{K'_{P}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K'_{p}K'_{Q}}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Exercise 2

### 1. For which value of L does the enzyme not have a T state? What happens to the rate equation in this case?

- No T state > $L=0$
- The rate become independent of the number of subunits
- $v=\frac{V_{max}^+\frac{S}{K_S}(1-\frac{P}{SK_{eq}})}{C_R}$
- Concerted change model: subunits change states together -> they are dependent
- When L is gone, there is no state transition, the subunits act like they are independent from each other

### 2. If the equilibrium constant really high, is the enzyme still reversible? Is the enzyme now still inhibited by the concentrations of its products

- the product can still _competitively bind_ to the catalytic site, even though product cannot go back to substrate from the reverse reaction
- the product term is still part of the binding polynomial, which affects the rate equation; see [Conceptual interpretation of rate equation](Biology/VU%20Basic%20Models%20of%20Biological%20Networks/5.%20VU%20BMBN%20Monomeric%20Enzyme%20Kinetics.md#Conceptual%20interpretation%20of%20rate%20equation)
- product _still inhibit_ the rate

### 3. Consider n = 4 and this mechanism

![[Media/5. VU BMBN Monomeric Enzyme Kinetics 2025-03-07 14.37.04.excalidraw]]

- Binding polynomial is $$\begin{aligned}
\mathcal{C_{R}}&=1+\frac{a}{K_{A}}+\frac{b}{K_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}+\frac{p}{K_{P}}+\frac{q}{K_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K_{P}K_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot q}{K_{A}K_{Q}}+\frac{b\cdot p}{K_{B}K_{P}}\\
\mathcal{C_{T}}&=1+\frac{a}{K'_{A}}+\frac{b}{K'_{B}}+\frac{a\cdot b}{K'_{A}K'_{B}}+\frac{p}{K'_{P}}+\frac{q}{K'_{Q}}+\frac{p\cdot q}{K'_{P}K'_{Q}}+\frac{a\cdot q}{K'_{A}K'_{Q}}+\frac{b\cdot p}{K'_{B}K'_{P}}
\end{aligned}
$$
- Consider no allosteric site, rate equation is: $$
v=\frac{4k^+e_{T} \frac{a\cdot b}{K_{A}K_{B}}(\mathcal{C_{R}})^3\left( 1- \frac{p\cdot q}{a\cdot b\cdot K_{eq}} \right)}{(\mathcal{C_{R}})^4+L(\mathcal{C_{R}})^4}
$$

## Example: phosphofructokinase (PFK) from E. Coli.

- ADO us both an activator and inhibitor depending on its con concentration and the concentration of the inhibitor
- Reactants (product or substrate) can also bind to the allosteric site
