## UniProt

- A large scale resort of protein sequences and functional information
	- Primary sequences including sequences of isoforms
	- Sub-cellular location, pathways, reaction, interactions, and involvement in disease
	- Structural information, 3D structure, and topology
	- Visualization tools
- Data Sources
	- Ensembl, PDB, Internation Protein Information Database
	- Unreviewed and reviewed
	- In unreviewed, isoforms are not grouped. In reviewed data, isoforms are grouped
- Data format: text, XML, XML/RDF, FASTA, GFF, tab-delimited
- Updates every 8 weeks

## Search on UniProt

- Search bar to search gene names or protein names or diseases
- Choose which database to search
- Batch search
- ID mapping: search multiple proteins at once
- Advanced search using boolean operators
- Search peptide sequence and restrict the taxonomy to a species
- Click on the accession number to see more information on the protein
- Cross references: referring to external databases for more information
- UniProtKB: all protein sequences
- UniprotKB reference proteomes + Swiss-Prot: species proteome + verified proteins, a good subset of the database

## Exploring protein sequence

- In the protein information page
- 3D structure information
- BLAST option: search for similar sequences
	- Search for full length sequence or part of the sequence
	- View alignment of the search result to the protein searched
	- Multiple sequence alignment: identify similar regions, find conserved regions or amino acid sequences, evolutional relationships
	- Display user-requested protein features tracks (ex. zinc finger. active site, metal binding, mutagenesis, etc.)
	- Can be limited for a particular species
- Feature viewer: variants that are likely benign, pathogenic, or uncertain
- Interaction: which pairs of protein interact together; how many experiments validated the interaction

## Accessing proteomes

- OVer 160,000 proteomes representing species belonging to the four super kingdoms Eukaryota, Bacteria, Archaea and Virus
- Unique identifiers for the proteins
- Protein sequence and functional information for a large number of species

## Access disease information

- For example, Parkinson's disease
- For non-human species, there are null mutant phenotype data and phenotype data due to RNAi and morpholino
- Identify which amino acid is affected by the mutation
