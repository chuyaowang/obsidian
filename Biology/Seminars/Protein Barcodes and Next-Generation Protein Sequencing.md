## Protein Barcode

- Barcodes made of amino acid sequences enable tracking of proteins at single molecule resolution
- The barcode is genetically encoded in the coding sequences for proteins
- The proteins are sequenced using next-generation protein sequencing on Quantum-Si' Platinum instrument

## Usage

- Multiplexed protein screening
- Protein trafficking within cells: barcoded proteins can be engineered with mutations in the putative trafficking domain. Organelles can be isolated. Sequencing the proteins in the organelles will reveal the identity of the protein variants present in the respective organelles
- Protein-protein interactions: a large panel of variants containing mutations at the interface can be created, and each one tagged with a unique barcode. How mutations at the interface affect protein-protein interaction can be studied
- Protein characterization: screen proteins from different mRNAs to identify which protein has the highest expression level for development of gene therapy
