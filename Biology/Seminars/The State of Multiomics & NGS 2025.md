## Keynote: The Road from HGP to Multiomics with Francis Collins

> Francis Collins
> Former NIH director
> Human genome consortium
> Human genome project

- Politics hampers science in the US
- Fewer research roles: migration to Europe, Asia, Australia
- Wrote a book: Road to Wisdom
- HGP:
	- Craig Ventor, Francis Collins
	- completed 25 years ago
	- Public access vs. private access to data
	- Economical impact of HGP: 3 billion dollars invested, 1 trillion return
	- Research: essential for biological science, cancer, infectious disease, inheritable disease research
	- RP11: DNA donor to HGP, best working library, African American
- Telomere to telomere (T2T) consortium: make complete genome
	- long reads help sequence long repetitive sequences such as telomeres
	- structural polymorphism
	- still challenging: length polymorphism
- Decreasing cost of sequencing:
	- Cost of sequencing dropped drastically
	- 100 dollar genome
- Lack of (ethnic) diversity in genomic database:
	- enroll participants from different racial backgrounds
	- Polygenic risk score: very dependent on the person's racial background
	- Genomic diversity: critical for precision medicine and precision health
		- Trump hears diversity, Trump ðŸ˜¡
	- Health disparity: survival rate depends on racial background
	- H3Africa: genome sequencing and researcher collaboration project in Africa
- Mendelian disease:
	- Cure for sickle cell developed from Collins' earlier work
	- Sickle cell anemia is a inheritable Mendelian genetic disease
- Cystic fibrosis:
	- Also a genetic disease whose gene was discovered by Collins
	- Drug developed for cystic fibrosis
	- Still expensive and does not work for some people
	- Future: CRISPR-Cas, gene editing
- Multiomics:
	- T2DM research: 
		- initial expectation: oligogenic, 8-10 genes, not that way, more than 600 now
		- understand the function and consequence of genes
		- what do non-coding sequences do?
		- iPSC from people whose phenotype is known, treatment to compare to people without dT2DM, genome sequencing, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, single cell sequencing
			- Treatment of beta cells with glucose
		- RNA modifications: how covalent changes on RNA related to function. RNA to cDNA loses this information. Nanopore can get this information.
	- Broad institute: progeria research project, David Liu
		- in vivo gene editing
		- gene editing apparatus delivered to heart
- Predictions: 
	- Complex genome landscape of disease
	- Precision medicine by sequencing everyone's genome
	- Clinical genomics

## Spatial Proteomics: Precision Oncology and the Human Protein Atlas

> Cecilia Lindskog, University of Uppsala, Human Proteome Atlas
> Fabian Coscia, Max DelbrÃ¼ck Center for Molecular Medicine, spatial proteomics


- Cecilia Lindskog: antibody based proteome
	- ovarian cancer research
- Fabian Coscia: imaging based spatial proteomics, exploratory proteomics
	- novel protein based drug targets
- Spatial proteomics:
	- Involves many different techniques; many old techniques exist; many new technologies are being developed
	- community effort to gather data
	- Definition: protein in space
		- ex. identify proteins in disease context; driver protein, signaling protein
		- targeted: imaging based
		- untargeted: exploratory
	- Spatial transcriptomics not always correlate with spatial proteomics
	- AI/ML: important for use of big data (in TBs)
	- Tissue heterogeneity can be learned from spatial proteomics
- Human proteome atlas:
	- Different organs, cell types, organelles, blood
	- Transcriptomics, proteomics
	- Classify genes according to expression
	- Cell type/Body location specific cell type -> understanding function
	- Transcriptomics does not have to agree with proteomics
	- Antibody validation schemes to validate protein staining truly reflects protein presence
- Precision oncology
	- Spatial proteomics for understanding tumor environment
	- Cell type stratification
	- Define cell state: ex. activated or inactive immune cell
	- Cell function
	- Cell-cell interaction
	- Finding optimal treatment
- Proteomics in the context of multiomics
	- Proteomics are closest to the phenotype
	- Integrate with transcriptomics, transcriptional factor signaling, metabolomics
	- MS based proteomics: phosphorylation events
		- Signaling events leading to phosphorylation
	- Proteomics in blood related to cancer progression
	- Early detection using proteomics
- Sensitivity and resolution
	- MS sensitivity has drastically improved: profile single cells or a few cells
	- still need development: phosphorylation
	- antibody based assay: developing multiplexed, collecting more data
	- AI tools for analysis
	- Data access
	- Integrating different information on the same tissue section
		- Methods on paraffin tissues need development
- What's next
	- Integrate methods to make easily available to clinics
	- Collaboration with hospital
	- Combine routine histopathology with more proteomics markers
	- AI to predict cell type, tissue environment, cell state, disease progression from small sample
	- Spatial proteomics becomes cheaper
