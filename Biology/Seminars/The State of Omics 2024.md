- Longitudinal personal omics profiling: ![](Screenshot%202024-04-17%20at%2023.08.33.png)
- Complex diseases are caused by many genetic changes of small effect - polygenic risk score
- Combine GWAS with open chromatin regions
- Different ageotypes (way of aging) defined by genotypes, associated clinical markers
- QBio: benefits of multi-variate longitudinal measurements for early detection including whole body MRI
	- A company?

	- Iollo: panel involving ~500 metabolites
- Future
	- Genome sequencing 
	- Personal devices
	- Personal health risk prediction, early diagnosis, monitoring, treatment

## Next-Gen Proteomics

> Simon Fredriksson, Pixelgen
> Spatial proteomics

- In-vitro, in-vivo production of antibodies that bind proteins
- AI design and production of antibodies
- Proteogenomics
- Disease detection with protein profile
	- limited protein in samples
	- protein isoforms
- Immune cell states: defined by spatial organization of surface proteins
	- reorganization changes function

## Spatial Omics

> Fei Chen, Broad Institute

- Sequencing based tools: capturing genomic information
- Imaging based tools: sequencing performed directly inside a single cell
- Slide-seq: high resolution bead arrays
	- Deposit beads into arrays ![](Pasted%20image%2020240418001013.png)
	- ![](Pasted%20image%2020240418001231.png)
- Tissue genomics has been a house divided: single cell and spatial transcriptomics done separately
	- Ideal to do single cell sequencing and get spatial information ![](Pasted%20image%2020240418001551.png)
- Slide-tag ![](Pasted%20image%2020240418004329.png)
	- Slide-tag followed by single nucleotide RNA-seq
	- Gene expression in each cell
	- Spatial location is obtained by relative positioning of the tags on the nuclei
- Differential transcriptional programs identified among samples
- Next: scaling to every single cell experiment, genomic and epigenomic measurements

Q&A:
- chemical modification: nothing particular, the cell is freeze-thawed to make it permeable
- expansion microscopy: sub-cellular resolution
- AI: discovery of cell programs for each cell type, rules and features that are recurrent for tissues
