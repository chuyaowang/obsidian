### Introduction

Cell & gene therapy CDMO, based on Oxford

### Accelerating research

- Two aspects
	- Blue skies research
	- Operation efficiencies

- Use LLMs to read user input and retrieve very specific response
- Two user groups
	- Experimental scientists
	- Computational scientists

### Reimagining research

- The evolution of our digital focus ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425230828.png)
- Current data system: a mix of different data formats ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425230941.png)
	- It gets more complicated at the departments and corporations levels
- Transformation journey: 
	- standardization and harmonization: harmonize workflows with a standard ontology ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425231239.png)
	- gather requirement: a digital solution where users can enter unstructured data in a structured format using intuitive interface which hallows flexible workflows and does not make data enter tedious
		- Workflow templates that is repeatable
		- Flexible for client needs
		- Scientists have many things at hand. It is critical to reduce the amount of clicking and going to pages required ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425231844.png)
	- evaluation: evaluated different platforms; they chose `sapio sciences`
	- implementation: achieve end-to-end digitization for the most common processes ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425232206.png)
- The result workflow ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425232416.png)
- Automation of data analysis and ML ![](Pasted%20image%2020240425232534.png)

## Sapio Sciences

### What they do

- ELN: electronic lab notebook
- LIMS: laboratory information management system
- Jarvis: scientific data cloud

### LLMs for Lab Informatics

- ELaiN: Electronic Lab AI-powered Notebook
	- Search queries with natural language (are bioinformaticians being replaced ðŸ˜±) 
	- Get sample information by just asking the chatbot
- Chat with documents
- Support assistant
- Coding assistant

### Making an AI Assistant Science-Aware

- Make it understand algorithms and theories
- Designing experiments, running algorithms for scientists

## Q&A

- What LLM do you use? Do you train or finetune it yourself? 
	- They use multiple, depending on which works best.
- How does it work? Do you ask LLM to write SQL queries and run the query? How to ensure it is correct? Sometimes it misses something or use outdated functions. 
	- Still needs to check the code and the result
	- Use own api and train it using the most up-to-date data
- Are bioinformaticians being replaced? Would simple data analysis be completely be replaced? What skills are still valuable?
	- Speeding up repetitive tasks: data cleaning, improving models, automating tasks
	- Learn domain-specific knowledge faster
	- Human expertise is still required
	- Be aware of the latest technologies and how to integrate it.
