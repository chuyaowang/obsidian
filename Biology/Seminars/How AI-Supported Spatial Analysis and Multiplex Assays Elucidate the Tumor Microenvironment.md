- A company that does assay design + experiment + whole data analysis pipeline and report generation;
- [Cloud](AWS%20Learning%20Resources.md)-based data analysis and data sharing.

## Why cloud?

Ease of [scaling](2.2%20Compute%20in%20the%20Cloud.md#^ccf4fc)
- horizontal scaling: add more processing nodes, process many images at the same time
- vertical scaling: make each node more powerful

## Will AI replace pathologists on reading histology slides

It will help them. Pathology is incredibly complicated.
