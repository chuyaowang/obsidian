Optical genome mapping is a technology used in genomics to analyze the structure of a genome. It involves mapping the entire genome by imaging individual DNA molecules. This is typically done by stretching the DNA molecules onto a surface and using fluorescent labels to identify specific sequences or structural variations. The resulting images are then analyzed to create a high-resolution map of the genome, which can reveal information about the order and arrangement of genes, as well as structural variations such as deletions, duplications, and rearrangements. This technology is particularly useful for studying large-scale genomic variations that may be difficult to detect using other methods, such as next-generation sequencing.
