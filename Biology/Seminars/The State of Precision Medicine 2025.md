## Transforming Healthcare: The Power and Potential of Point of Care Diagnostics

> Mara Aspinall, Illumina Ventures

- Diagnostics (Dx): a journey
	- screening
	- early detection
	- diagnosis
	- prognosis
	- therapy
	- post-therapy
- Diabetes testing
	- early history: taste urine see if sweet
	- later: urine test strip
	- today: continuous glucose meter
	- one data point vs. multiple time points
	- tells disease from a trend
	- Add: continuous monitoring data, integrated with _drug delivery_ and _AI_
- History medicine
	- To 1400: superstition and folklore
	- 1400-1700: scientific discovery
	- 1700-1962: trial and error
	- 1962 to today: personalized medicine; 
		- in 1962 FDA began to require clinical trials
		- testing is important
- COVID testing
	- from thousands of dollars to tens of dollars
	- from invasive in-hospital to _home-testing_
- Home testing in history
	- Urine
	- Cholesterol
	- Blood pressure
- Home testing development
	- Saliva swaps
	- Wrist bands
	- Fecal sample collection at home
	- DNA sample collection
- Why move to at home
	- Decentralization: lower cost at home
	- Limited skilled healthcare labor
	- Patient agency: convenient and flexible, privacy; hospital at home for chronic illness
	- Technology and business models: easier to do tests at home
	- Core: explosion of **chronic diseases**; as people live longer, these diseases need to be treated for longer
- Drugs at home:
	- Easier drug administration devices
	- Asthma pen
	- Plaque psoriasis on-body injector
- Samples are easier:
	- Less and less invasive sampling required to do testing
	- 3 types of diease
		- established: saliva, stool, blood, etc.
		- emerging: gait for dementia, breath/cough for asthma, etc.
		- experimental: hair for autism, tears for parkinson's, etc.
- 2024
	- FDA approved 7 new tests
	- RADx Tech Maternal Health Challenge
- The past and future of testing
	- is there disease
	- what disease
	- what subtype
	- identify risk
	- pre-empt disease
- Tools
	- the senses of physicians
	- manual tools
	- automated lab systems
	- data analytics
	- diagnostics, therapeutics, AI
- Testing in the future
	- Integrated with data
		- Clinical data, genomic, imaging, consumer apps, patient history, tissue diagnostics, drug interactions , point of care tests, clinical trials
		- integrated summary of patient data
		- emergence of data intepretor
			- person or machine
			- physician or patient
			- real data or AI created
	- Integrated with drugs
		- drugs related to _biomarkers_
- Companion diagnostics (CDx) FDA approvals
	- biomarker tests
	- 172 CDx associated with 64 unique therapies
	- small molecule 48%, monoclonal antibody 20%, other 32%
	- 65% of CDx approvals are for 7 biomarkers
	- cancer-related
- biomarker testing for cancer and other diseases expanding access
- beyond oncology
	- CNS
	- autoimmune
	- metabolic, cardiovascular
- tech advances
	- digital pathology
	- Dx for drugs
	- AI
- questions
	- what is the next game changing market
	- who will train physician to testing and precision medicine
	- hwo will payor reimburse for tests including home tests
	- how far can AI accelerate testing

## Functional Precision Medicine - A Powerful Tool in Precision Oncology

Manmeet Ahluwalia, MD Miami Cancer Institute
Diana Azzam, PhD First Ascent Biomedical
Prasanth Reddy, MD, AdventHealth
Raymond Rodriguez-Torres, ALC Home Health

- talked useless crap

## Challenges and Practice Gaps Affecting Implementation of Oncology Precision Medicine

> Nikoletta Sidiropoulos, MD Vermont Medical Center
> Heidi Ko, DO, LapCorp
> Marni Tierno, PhD, RN, Illumina

### Specimen collection

- insufficient tissue collected
- bad biomarker testing performance
- insufficient cell content in sample

## Multi-omics and Promise for Precision Medicine

> Henry W. Long, PhD, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
> Paivi Ostling, PhD, SciLifeLab

### SciLifeLab

- National infrastructure for Sweden
- Genomics, transcriptomics
- Spatial biology

### Dana-Farber

- Genomics
- Single cell, spatial technology
- Translational research
- Wet lab + dry lab

### Bladder cancer

- SciLifeLab
- Cancer subtype from transcriptomics
- biochemical assays, proteomics, transcriptomics in cancer research
- cell type and their neighborhood from spatial
- biomarkers: protein markers, omic phenotypes of cancer cells
- developed various diagnosis panels for bladder cancer

### Epigenetics

- Dana-Farber
- Large panel or whole exosome sequencing of cancer tissue of patients already common
- Multi-omic analysis displayed similarity between different cancers at the same anatomical location

### Tracking the dynamic nature of cancer

- Follow biomarker levels through the disease
- Blood sample, urine sample are easy to take. Biopsies of tissues or bone marrows on the other hand are difficult to track regularly
- Preventive tests from regular blood tests combined with new technology (such as DL)

### Drug sensitivity from clinical genomics

- Learn drug response from genomics
- SciLifeLab: drug repurposing studies for cancer patients
- DF: larger biobanks of patient models with multi-omics data
	- **ProXe**: patient repository of xenograft models: genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomics, drug sensitivities
	- University of Washington for prostate cancer xenograft models
- Organoid models: more realistic, more labor intensive
- SciLifeLab: large biobank, long time multi-omic population-based study

### Data & AI

- DF: spatial
	- reduces material needed
	- near genome wide, near single cell resolution
	- AI and _computational pathology_ for spatial data
	- spatial information could aid in interpretability of DL features
- SLL: make predictions using multi-omics and spatial data
	- The data-driven life science: a new program
- Need for data sharing

### Ending words

- single cell studies will be mainstream
- platform unifying wet lab and dry lab
- more systematic way of working for improved data access
