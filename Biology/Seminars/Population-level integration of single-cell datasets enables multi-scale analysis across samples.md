## Motivation  

Single-cell atlases are growing in size and scope, promising to link detailed cellular profiles with sample-level metadata (e.g., disease status, demographics). However, integrating hundreds to thousands of heterogeneous single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) cohorts remains challenging. Batch effects, varying technologies and uneven cell type annotations impede consistent analyses and label transfer. The authors introduce scPoli, a semi-supervised generative framework designed to integrate population-scale single-cell datasets, learn both cell- and sample-level representations, and enable accurate cross-sample annotation without retraining.

## Research Question  

How can one build a scalable, interpretable model that:  
- Integrates thousands of scRNA-seq samples with diverse technical and biological properties.  
- Simultaneously corrects batch effects while preserving genuine biology.  
- Learns compact embeddings for samples and cells to support multi-scale analysis, label transfer and reference mapping in an “open-world” (novel cell types) setting?  

---

## Background  

Single-cell data integration methods aim to place cells from different studies into a common latent space, removing technical artifacts while conserving cell-type biology.

Key challenges:  
- **Batch correction vs. biology preservation**: Aggressive correction can erase real phenotypic signals.  
- **Scalability**: One-hot encoding (OHE) of conditions adds parameters linearly with sample count.  
- **Label transfer**: Annotating new datasets against a reference typically requires full-model retraining or sharing raw data.  
- **Open-world scenarios**: New cell types or rare phenotypes may be absent from reference annotations.

### Data Types & Acquisition  

scPoli was evaluated on:  
- **Benchmark datasets**: Six published scRNA-seq collections (pancreas, PBMC, lung, cross-species), each split into reference and query cohorts.  
- **Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA)**: 166 samples, 11 studies, ~1.3 M lung cells with curated cell-type labels.  
- **COVID-19 PBMC**: Two cohorts totaling ~780 K cells across ~370 samples, covering healthy to severe disease.  
- **Mega-PBMC atlas**: 7.8 M cells from 2,375 samples, 25 datasets spanning healthy and disease states.  
- **Cross-species data**: Mouse, marmoset reference with human query via ortholog genes.  
- **scATAC-seq**: NeurIPS 2021 multimodal dataset for chromatin accessibility integration.  

Reference and query labels were drawn from published annotations or harmonized by expert curation.

## Relevant Theories  

- **Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE)**: Learns latent representations of cells conditioned on batch covariates.  
- **Prototype-based Meta-learning**: Uses class “prototypes” (centroids in latent space) for few-shot classification and uncertainty estimation.  
- **Continuous Condition Embeddings**: Replace one-hot batch vectors with fixed-size trainable embeddings to scale with many samples and capture similarity between conditions.  
- **Open-world Learning**: Incorporates mechanisms to flag “unknown” cell types by measuring embedding distance to prototypes.  

---

## Methodology  

1. **Architecture**  
   - Encoder–decoder network (CVAE) that ingests gene expression + concatenated sample embedding(s).  
   - Learns two sets of embeddings:  
     * **Sample embeddings** (fixed dimension) capturing technical/biological covariates.  
     * **Cell latent vectors** (zᵢ) from which prototypes for each cell type are computed.  

2. **Prototype Loss**  
   - Encourages each labeled cell to lie near its type-prototype in latent space.  
   - Unlabeled/query cells are assigned the nearest prototype label; embedding distance yields an uncertainty score.

3. **Reference Mapping**  
   - Freeze model weights on reference.  
   - Introduce new embeddings for query batches without altering network parameters.  
   - Efficiently map and classify query cells.

4. **Multi-covariate Modeling**  
   - Independently embed multiple batch covariates (e.g., experiment, cohort) and concatenate them to inputs, enabling disentangling of different technical effects.

## Results  

### Benchmark Integration & Label Transfer  
- scPoli outperformed scANVI, Seurat v3, scVI, Symphony, MARS and linear SVM in combined integration (mean integration score +5.1% vs. best competitor).  
- Prototype loss drove superior biological conservation, while continuous embeddings supported robust batch correction.

### Human Lung Cell Atlas (HLCA)  
- Integrated 11 core studies (166 samples), preserving cell-type clustering (UMAP) and achieving higher conservation than scANVI.  
- Sample embeddings stratified by study and by anatomical metadata; PCs highlighted technical vs. biological drivers.

### Query Mapping & Unknown Cell Detection  
- Mapped healthy and cancer lung queries to HLCA reference.  
- Achieved 80% cell-type accuracy on pancreas benchmark; 75–85% accuracy in discovering “unknown” cell types (cancer cells, Schwann cells).  
- Outperformed kNN-based and scANVI uncertainty approaches.

### Sample-level Disease Classification  
- COVID-19 PBMC embedding PCs correlated with disease severity.  
- kNN classifier on scPoli embeddings predicted sample disease state with 73% accuracy (F1 ≈ 65%), outperforming classifiers on pseudobulk expression or scVI latents.

### Covariate Selection Guidance  
- In a multi-cohort COVID PBMC set, sample embeddings revealed that “experiment” and “cohort” dominated batch effects while disease appeared in higher PCs.  
- Conditioning on dominant covariates yielded faster, equally robust integration vs. using sample-level covariates alone.

### Scalability & Extensions  
- Modeled 2,375 samples without parameter bloat, integrating 7.8 M cells.  
- Integrated cross-species data (mouse + marmoset → human), achieving 86% cross-species label transfer.  
- Applied to scATAC-seq, matching PeakVI performance.

## Key Computational Problem Addressed  

At its core, scPoli tackles the challenge of **scaling population-level single-cell integration** by:  
- **Representing thousands of samples** with fixed-size continuous embeddings, avoiding parameter explosion of OHE.  
- **Balancing batch effect removal** against preservation of true biological variation via a conditional CVAE augmented with prototype loss.  
- **Supporting open-world label transfer** by leveraging latent prototypes and embedding distances to detect novel cell types.  
- **Enabling multi-covariate disentanglement**, guiding users to select appropriate batch covariates for integration.  
- **Facilitating reference mapping without data sharing** by freezing model weights and training only new embeddings, critical for privacy-sensitive clinical data.

## Implications and Clinical Relevance  

By providing a unified framework for integrating vast, heterogeneous single-cell cohorts, scPoli empowers:  
- **Disease atlas construction** linking patient metadata (age, disease severity, treatment) to cellular states.  
- **Automated annotation** of new samples (e.g., tumor biopsies, immunology studies) without full retraining or raw data exchange.  
- **Meta-analysis across conditions** to identify markers of pathology, therapeutic response or demographic influences.  
- **Experimental design guidance**, as sample embeddings highlight dominant technical or biological variation, streamlining batch-correction strategies.

In clinical contexts, scPoli can accelerate biomarker discovery, improve diagnostic cell-type calling in complex tissues, and support precision medicine by mapping patient samples onto large reference atlases.
