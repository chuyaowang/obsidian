- Limitation in current protein assessment:
	- Stability: DSC or DSF
	- Aggregation: SEC or AUC
	- Structure: CD, FTIR, NMR
	- Quantitation: UV Vis or Assays

- MMS:
	- Broad dynamic range: 0.1 to >200 mg/ml
	- High sensitivity: 0.75% LOQ

- PRotein structure
	- 1: MS
	- 2: Circular dichroism (CD), FTIR
	- 3: SEC, NMR
	- 4: (Dynamic light scattering) DLS, SEC

- MMS detects secondary structure:
	- QCL based transmission IR technology
	- Probes the vibrational response of carbonyl groups

- Data processing:
	- Second derivative to identify similarity spectra
	- Invert and baseline
	- Gaussian deconvolution

- Case study: structural aggregation
	- IgG in PBS + 10% n-propanol
	- Pressure-treated with 60,000 psi to form aggregates
	- Spiked into untreated sample

- Analytics software:
	- X axis: wavelength
	- Y axis: intensity
	- Stability, similarity, HOS analysis

## Case study: lens protein

> Dr. Dragana Catici, Technical University of Munich

- Cataract: opacification of the eye.
- Proteins in the eye:
	- No turnover. They last for a lifetime.
	- Very high concentration, 450 mg/mL
- Aim: the effect of high concentration of protein on structure and stability.

## Case study: cholera
