## State of Personalized Medicine

- Personalized gene editing;
- Cancer vaccine;
- Checkpoint inhibitors have shown some success;
- Pancreatic cancer, Melanoma cancer vaccines have seen impressive data;
- Currently tested in early cancer patients.

## Nobel Prize in mRNA Therapeutics

- mRNA vaccine has influenced many people, on the same level of polio vaccine;
- Future medicine direction.

## Tom Madden

- How to achieve greater potency;
- Efficient delivery

## Tasuku Kitada

- Programming mRNA to be cell-type specific.

## Providence

- Platform for academics and professionals;
- Using lipids as adjuvants;
- Oncology, anti-virus therapeutics;
- Manufacturing of lipid nanoparticles.

## Personalized Medicine vs. Traditional Medicine

- Cancer vaccine must be tailored to the patient's genome;
- Need to scale up quickly for mass production sometimes, like COVID-19

## Challenges

- Prove the efficacy and safety;
- Development speed, need to be fast enough for aggressive cancer;
	- Currently about 8 weeks;

## Knowledge Gap

- Algorithm: genome sequence -> Identifying target
- Selecting tumor cells that are resistant to treatment;
- Targeting multiple neoantigens;
- Microrevolution;
- Immune escape;

## Validation

- COVID validated efficacy of mRNA vaccine;
- Minor side effects observed in COVID vaccines;
- Need to further prove safety and efficacy;

## Manufacturing Challenges

- How to produce drugs for every individual using a consistent and robust method;
- 20 doses for one patient -> billions of doses for lots of people;
- Reduce cost and increase speed;
- Packaging and transport;
- Functional nanoparticles: scale to clinical and industrial scale.

## LNPs

- Lipid nanoparticles;
- Crossing the blood-brain-barrier is a challenge;
- Consistent homogenous distribution in the brain;
- Prevent immune trafficking;
- Delivery to the target tissue.

## Dosing

- circular mRNA;
- mRNA allows higher protein expression for longer time;
- Cancer vaccines need months of expression and multiple injections;
- When is it appropriate for permanent or semi-permanent gene editing;

## Future Perspectives

- Find more mutations in more patients;
- Better cancer vaccines, more affordable, more effective;
- More disease coverage, expressing multiple antigens.

## Q&A

- Important for collaboration among industry, hospital, and academia;
- Amount, purity of protein, particle size are important metrics;
- LNPs still the dominant delivery material;
- AI/ML widely used in drug discovery, clinical data management, quality control, patient data analysis and monitoring;
