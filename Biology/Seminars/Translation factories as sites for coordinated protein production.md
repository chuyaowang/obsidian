## Proteins

- proteinsl metabolic reactions and structural and regulatory roles
- made from mRNA
- don't know: how cells regulate protein synthesis

## Translation

43S complex
80S complex

## RIP-seq to study mRNA selection for translation initiation

- RIP-seq: 
- translation process does not just enable the bulk production of protein
- mRNA interact with translation factors very differently
- regulation of protein levels in the cells
- fate of mRNA in cytosol is very complex

## mRNA in cytosol

- RIP-seq to study mRNA degradation

## mRNA - TF interaction

- mRNA-TF interaction heatmap - 7 mRNA clusters identified
- 3 basic mRNA profiles reflecting different roles in cells

## RNA regulon hypothesis

- functionally similar or co-regulated mRNAs are orchestrated in the post-transcription level via the cohort of RBPs that they bind to

## Where are translation factors and mRNA?

- certain mRNAs reside in granules even in unstressed cells
	- translation factor mRNAs
	- glycolytic mRNAs
	- aromatic amino acid biosynthesis

## Confirmation of mRNA localization by smFISH

- mRNAs localize to multi-mRNA granules, identified by MS2 smFISH
- Glycolytic mRNAs overlap to the same set of multi-mRNA granules

## mRNAs appear translated in granules (factories)

- proteins are translated at mRNA granules
- Why:
	- co-regulated expression
	- co-translational protein complex assembly at the factory

## How are they formed and inherited during cell division

- translation factor mRNA granules are preferentially inherited by the yeast daughter cell
- the translation factor mRNA molecules are in multi-mRNA granules higher proportion for the glycolytic
	- starter pack
	- allows the mother to direct protein production in daughter cell
- the extent of glycolytic mRNA localization correlates with the fermentative status of the cell
	- CoFe granules: core fermentation granules

## Co-translational protein complex assembly

- different mRNAs in the same place contributing to an assembled protein
- many (40%) protein complexes assemble co-translationally
- puromycin proteomics

## back to mRNA clustering

- how are mRNA selected for entry into translation factories
- mRNAs that are important to translate interact poorly with translation factors, they are also located in granules
