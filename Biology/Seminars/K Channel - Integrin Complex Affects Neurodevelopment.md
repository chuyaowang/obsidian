## Steps

1. Identified Kcnb1_R312H, a voltage-sensing protein in potassium channel as an important factor in neurodevelopment.
2. Evaluated knockin mice with/without mutations in the protein.
3. The reason is that the mutations caused morphological and neural migration errors using cell staining.
4. Found the K channel - integrin complex, which is a part of the non-conducting signaling of ion channels, to be responsible for the errors in growth. The signals are transducted when the voltage sensing protein moves. Hence, conducting and non-conducting functions of the protein cannot be separated.
5. Correcting the error in the signal transduction path rescued the phenotype in mice with mutation.
