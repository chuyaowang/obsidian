## The Organoids: Derivations and Applications

### Introduction

Definition: 3D structures derived from pluripotent stem cells, neonatal or adult steam/progenitor cells grown in vitro.

### Deriving Organoids

- Key aspects: *self-assembly* and *differentiation*. 
- Organoid development entails self-organization of a somewhat homogenous cell population
- Self-organization has two parts:
	- **Self patterning**: development of cell differentiation patterns in an originally homogenous system due to *system-autonomous processes* and *intracellular communication*.
		- Proposed mechanism: reaction-diffusion mechanisms, bistabilities of regulatory networks, and asymmetric cell division.
	- **Morphogenetic rearrangements**: sorting of various cell types within tissue and the higher-level reorganization of the system's architecture.
		- Dominated by mechanical properties of cell contacts: cell adhesion, cortical tension and contractility, and cell motility.
		- Also by system mechanical properties influenced by cell shape changes, cell contraction, cell movement, or differential tissue expansion.
		- Other factors: physical characteristics of the cultural environment; requirements for system autonomous (i.e., endogenous) and/or exogenous signals; and initial cell types and system conditions

### Physical Properties of the Culture Environment

The organoids can be developed in:
- Matrigel: a natural ECM purified Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm rat sarcoma.
	- Intestinal, cerebral, gastric, and mammary gland organoids have been developed with Matrigel.
- Type I collagen matrix
	- Intestinal and mammary gland organoids have been developed.
	- Hard to control composition, high batch variation, low repeatability.
- Hydrogels
	- Intestinal and brain organoids.
	- Less bioactive.
- Suspension cultures
	- Optic cup, cerebral, cerebellar, and hippocampal organoids.
- Air-liquid interfaces
	- Renal organoid. Cells are grown on a porous membrane at the interface of culture media and air.

The choice of material is currently mostly empirical.

### Endogenous and Exogenous Signals

Organoids development requires exposing the initial cell populations to certain morphogens at a specific time point. When all the required components are met, these signals cause self-organization.

Some organoids can be formed entirely with endogenous signals, while others require exogenous provision of missing components.

For example, exogenous signals are required to activate hPSCs so that they differentiate into a desired cell population.

### Cell Sources, Initial Culture Condition, and  Starting Cell Type

#### Cell Sources

- Primary tissue
- Differentiated from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs): embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
- PSC-derived organoids can mimic the heterogeneity of real tissues, but can derive into unintended cell types.
- Organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells may exhibit a gene expression pattern more reminiscent of fetal tissue than from their adult counterparts.

#### Initial Culture Condition

Before self-organization can happen, the cells need an initial stage for growth.
- One method is to differentiate the cell types independently before culturing them together. In this way, self-organization mostly includes cell sorting and subsequent architectural rearrangements.
- Another way is to grow the cell types concurrently. 

The method affects how the model can be interpreted:
- Independently cultured cell types are not fit for understanding organogenesis.
- More useful to study the transitory interaction between the progenitor cells in the organoids.

#### Starting Cell Type

Affects the types of the organoid formed:
- PSCs: neuroectodermal organoids, such as the optic cup and cerebral organoids, and mesodermal renal organoids.
- Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) or dissociated adult tissue: organoids from surface ectoderm lineages (especially glandular tissue)
- Endodermal lineage organoids can originate from both PSCs and ASCs.

Stem cells in different organs are activated at different situations:
- ASCs or adult tissue fragments are thought to create organoids that replicate their original tissue’s homeostatic or regenerative circumstances.
	- Stem cells derived from organs with a high renewal rate, such as the epithelium of the small intestine, colon or stomach, generate organoids that mimic the *homeostatic role* of these cells in vivo. 
	- Organoids produced from slow turnover tissue, such as the pancreas or liver, in which endogenous stem cells and/or progenitors may play a role only the following damage, on the other hand, are regarded as genuine *regeneration* models.

The type of research determines what cell source should be used:
- ASC-derived organoids can help researchers address concerns regarding the biology of adult tissues. 
- PSC-derived organoids are primarily utilized to research organogenesis and tissue development.
- PSC organoids resemble fetal tissues and do not progress to mature cell types.

#### Embryonic Organoids

- A different type of organoids, also called "embryoids" or "gastruloids".
- Mimic in a very simple way pre-implantation and early post-implantation embryo development, body axis formation, gastrulation, and neural tube development.
- Contain cells from multiple germ layers as in real embryos.

#### Fetal Progenitor-derived Organoids

- Started directly from the fetal tissue.
- Can be used to study advanced organogenesis.
#### Developmental Signals

### Application of Organoids

#### Development, Homeostasis, and Regeneration

- Recreate in vitro some organ biology principles and differentiate the relative contributions of distinct tissue components to complicated morphogenetic processes.
- Compare human mechanisms to other animals' mechanisms.
#### Disease Modeling

- Mimic pathology at the organ level.
- Model genetic diseases, pathogen-host interactions, and cancer.
- Model other congenital and acquired diseases.

#### Congenital Diseases

- Cystic fibrosis model:
	- Organoids missing CFTR expression were created and compared with healthy organoids.
	- CRISPR-Cas was used to fix the mutation, and CFTR function became normal again.

#### Acquired Diseases

- Acquired mutations in cancer.
	- Lung, stomach, liver, pancreatic, colon, Van, prostate, endometrial, breast, bladder, esophageal, and brain cancers.
	- Cell sources: tissue resection, biopsy, and circulating tumor cells.
	- Can be easily expanded and used for drug testing.
- Infectious diseases.
	- Gastric organoids: Helicobacter pylori infection.
	- Pulmonary organoids: influenza.
	- Intestinal organoids: MERS coronavirus.
	- Several ASC organoids: SARS-Cov-2.

#### Drug Discovery and Personalized Medicine

- Identifying biomarkers, personalize drug testing, drug screening, and toxicology studies.
- Parallel studies in organoids and animal models can be carried out.
- Patient derived organoids can be used for drug testing, drug development, and toxicity screening.
- Organoid biobanks can make screening variants of cancer much easier.

#### Regenerative Medicine

- Organoids as a source of cell therapy and as an alternative to whole organ transplants.
- Example: transplantation of retinal sheets derived from mouse ESCs or iPSCs using a modiﬁed optical cup organoid protocol in mice with retinal degeneration.
- Example: intestinal organoids derived from dissociated mouse colon epithelium or single stem cells implanted into mice can repair colonic mucosal damage to various degrees.
- CRISPR/Cas9 can be used to correct affects genes and select appropriate clones before autologous transplantation.

### Challenges

- Repeatability of organoids.
- Organoid capacity: how many cell types the organoid can recapitulate.
- Low level of maturity, especially for PSC-derived organoids.

#### Improve Maturity

- Increase lifespan of organoids:
	- Lifespan is limited because nutrients are delivered by diffusion.
		- Use bioreactors to increase nutrient supply through constant culture spinning.
	- Use artificial vascular tissue.
		- Sacrificial molds and laser ablation.
		- 3D printed scaffold.
		- Incorporate endothelial cells or their progenitors.
	- Longer culture time. Additional simulations such as physical disturbance.

#### Improve Organoid Architecture

- Organoid's self assembled structure is different from a real organ's architecture.
- Use a stem cell culture scaffold with tissue-appropriate topography.
	- Micro-collagen gels have been used to cultivate a single layer of self-renewing human colonic cells.
- Improved hydrogels: precise control of interaction with ECM, free of animal products, controlled alteration, low lot-to-lot variability.
	- Hyaluronan-based hydrogel: cerebral organoids.
	- Poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogel: neural tube cysts.
	- Hydrogels with spatial temporal adjustable properties.
- Controlling cell positioning is useful for:
	- Controlling self-organization.
	- Skewing cell-type-specific spatial interactions.
	- Altering nutrient and signal molecules availability.

#### Improve Disease Modeling

- Co-culture to simulate multi-organ disease.
- Organ-on-chip to build a 3D system.
