# AlphaGenome: advancing regulatory variant effect prediction with a unified DNA sequence model

#paper 

## Motivation  

Interpreting non-coding genomic variation remains a core challenge in genomics, as over 98% of human variants fall outside protein-coding regions and can modulate diverse regulatory processes—chromatin state, transcription, splicing and 3D genome architecture—often in a cell-type specific manner. Existing deep learning models either handle long-range context at coarse resolution (e.g., Enformer) or achieve base-pair precision on short windows (e.g., SpliceAI), and they usually specialize in one assay type, limiting comprehensive variant effect prediction across modalities. AlphaGenome is motivated by the need for a single model that jointly captures distal regulatory interactions over up to 1 Mb of DNA while delivering nucleotide-resolution outputs across dozens of molecular readouts, simplifying variant interpretation workflows.

## Research Question  

Can a single deep learning framework process megabase-scale DNA sequence to predict hundreds of genomic tracks—encompassing gene expression, splicing, chromatin accessibility, histone marks, transcription factor binding and chromatin contacts—at base-pair resolution, and accurately score the functional impact of sequence variants across all these modalities without per-task retraining?

## Background  

- Sequence-to-function models map DNA sequence to genome “tracks”—quantitative readouts from assays like RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, Hi-C and splice junction counts.  
- Specialized models (SpliceAI for splicing; Orca for 3D contacts) excel on narrow tasks but lack cross-modality scope. Conversely, generalist models (Enformer, Borzoi) cover multiple assays but trade output granularity for context length, blurring fine features like splice sites or TF footprints.  
- DeepMind’s prior model, Enformer, demonstrated that transformer-augmented convolutional networks can leverage ~200 kb context for multiscale predictions but only at 32–128 bp bins, motivating innovations to scale to 1 Mb at 1 bp resolution.  

### Data Types and Acquisition  

Training and evaluation leveraged public consortia data covering human and mouse genomes:  
- Gene expression: RNA-seq, CAGE, PRO-cap (base resolution)  
- Splicing: donor/acceptor sites, splice usage, splice junction counts (1 bp)  
- Chromatin accessibility: DNase-seq, ATAC-seq (1 bp)  
- Histone modifications & TF binding: ChIP-seq (128 bp)  
- Chromatin contact maps: Hi-C/micro-C (2 048 bp)  
Sources included ENCODE, GTEx, 4D Nucleome and FANTOM5, spanning hundreds of tissues and cell lines.

## Relevant Theories  

- **U-Net and Residual Connections**: Encoder-decoder architectures with skip links preserve spatial information for pixel- or base-level predictions, while residual blocks stabilize training in deep networks.  
- **Convolution vs. Self-Attention**: Convolutions capture local sequence motifs; transformer blocks model long-range regulatory dependencies such as enhancer–promoter loops within the 1 Mb context.  
- **Teacher–Student Distillation**: Ensembles of cross-validation “teacher” models guide a single “student” network to reproduce consensus predictions, enhancing robustness and efficiency for variant scoring.  
- **Sequence Parallelism**: Partitioning the 1 Mb input across multiple TPUs enables training at base resolution without exceeding memory limits.

## Methodology  

1. **Model Architecture**  
   - Input: 1 Mb DNA one-hot encoded, with species identity flag (human/mouse).  
   - Encoder: Convolutional layers downsample to multi-scale embeddings.  
   - Middle: Transformer blocks exchange information across devices.  
   - Decoder: Upsamples to produce two 1D outputs (at 1 bp and 128 bp) and one 2D output (for contacts).  
   - Output Heads: Task-specific linear layers predict 5 930 human or 1 128 mouse tracks across 11 assay types.  
2. **Training Regime**  
   - **Pre-training**: Four-fold cross-validation on reference genome intervals; fold-specific models evaluated on held-out sequences.  
   - **All-folds Teacher**: Models trained on full genome.  
   - **Distillation**: Student model learns from frozen ensemble teachers using augmented (shifted, reverse-complemented, mutated) inputs, yielding a single efficient predictor for variant effect scoring.  
3. **Inference**  
   - Student model predicts both reference and alternative sequences to compute per-track variant effect scores in under one second on an H100 GPU.

## Implications and Clinical Relevance  

By unifying long-range context and base-pair precision across diverse regulatory assays, AlphaGenome provides a single, extensible framework for interpreting non-coding variation at scale. Researchers can:  
- Prioritize candidate causal variants in GWAS and QTL studies without juggling multiple specialized tools.  
- Generate mechanistic hypotheses—e.g., disrupted TF motifs or altered enhancer–promoter contacts—for downstream experimental validation.  
- Facilitate clinical variant interpretation in regulatory regions, improving diagnostic pipelines and guiding therapeutic target discovery, particularly for diseases driven by non-coding mutations such as T-ALL at the TAL1 locus.  

AlphaGenome thus addresses a critical clinical bottleneck: rapid, accurate assessment of non-coding variant pathogenicity to inform precision medicine.
