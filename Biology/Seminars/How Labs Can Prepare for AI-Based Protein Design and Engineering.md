## Cradle Bio

- NL company
- Improve protein design with AI
- Works zero-shot and improves with more data
- SAAS company

### LLM for protein

- Sequences can be thought of as an unknown programming language or machine code
- ML can be used to find relationship between sequence and function
- LLM really quick: train model to fill in words
- Analogy for protein: remove amino acids from sequence and ask the model to fill in
- Lab data is used to teach predicting the relationship between protein properties and sequences

### Application

- Improve protein design, like increasing melting temperature

## Adapt your lab to ML

### Cradle lab

- Their own lab
- Generate data to validate and test their models

### ML requires less data than you think

A 96 well plate of clean data is often enough to personalize Cradle's core ML models to your specific protein sequence

Variances in experimental conditions need to be corrected. The more noise there is, the more the time the model will spend to denoise the data.
### Sequence diversity

Introduce sequence diversity with control

### Few user interaction

- Transfer data directly from machine to the software.

### Lab workflow

### Future of AI for protein design

Sequence based model: experimental data can be used to improve the model, not good at full de novo design, 
Structure based model: not a lot of diversity


contrastive learning

ML to predict how to adjust metabolic network to improve output?
