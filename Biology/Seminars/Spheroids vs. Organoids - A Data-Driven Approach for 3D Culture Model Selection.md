# Spheroids vs. Organoids

## Definitions

- Spheroids: self-assembled cell aggregates, recreating 3D environment compared to 2D cultures;
- Organoids: more complex, recapitulating organ function, made of multiple cell types, come from stem cells;
- Organ-on-chip: microfluidic platform that mimic the shear forces cells are under in the body, cell lines are usually used, organoids can also be used in the chip.

## Compared to 2D platform

- Recreate 3D environment for research fields such as neurological diseases;
- Spheroids can have multiple cell types, but no organization;
- Spheroids can be used for drug testing;
- Organoids provide important information related to spatial organization of cells;
- An example is intestinal organoids;
- Organoids for precision medicine: recreating physiology on individual-to-individual basis.

## Limitation with organoids

- Complexity in cell culture;
- Time-consuming;
- 5-15 µm droplets containing the patient cells are placed on surfaces treated or not treated with tissue culture;
- Non-standardized culture protocol;
- Expensive materials.

## Limitation with spheroids

- Not possible for every type of cell;
- Not always uniform;
- Size limitation: if it is too big, cells inside die;
- Visualizing inside the spheroid.

## Reproducibility

- Organoids are passaged by shearing organoids into pieces. This can result in non-uniform fragments;
- Developing automation processes to produce organoids;

## How to choose

- Determine the goal of the assay;
- May need to break the goal into parts, different assays, to achieve the goal;
- Drug toxicity: spheroid will suffice; Protein function, drug mechanism: organoid;
- Spheroid: drug toxicity screening, stem cell differentiation study;
- Organoid: when genetic diversity matters (library of different people's cells), personalized medicine
- Wrong model can result in wasted resources; 
- Too simple a model will not answer sufficiently the question.

## Application fields

- Organoids: genetic diversity matters for the disease, choosing chemotherapy in personalized medicine;
- Spheroids: differentiate and expand iPSCs, easy to scale up stem cell production.

## Tools for advancement

- Organoids: reproducibility, consistent size in shearing, good synthetic hydrogel instead of natural ones;
- Spheroids: high-throughput, automation, bioprinting to create domes.

## New Regulation

- Animal testing no longer required to push drug to market;
- In vitro models will become more important;
- Maintain the same level of biological relevance;
- Using organoids from human might give better results.

## QAs

- How many cells to seed?
	- Try different cell densities.
- What size domes for human cultures?
	- 3-5 µm for greater growth factor penetration.
- How to prevent organoids attach to the bottom of plate?
	- Flip the plate so bigger organoids settle on the dome.
	- Using non-treated plates reduces clustering.
- How to break down to single cells: enzymatic dissociation.
- Protocols for starters: Corning website, papers.
- Choosing the right size: assays, staining, confocal microscopy to determine necrosis limit.
- Size limitation: no set size; different cells behave differently when forming an organoid; try and evaluate.
- Prevent necrosis: optimize medium change frequency; choose the right size for the goal.
- Nucleotide delivery into cells: optimize concentration and time (just diffusion).
- Success case: cystic fibrosis drug discovery.
- Quantification methods: size, ATP assays, fluorescence, immunofluorescence; at least 3 replicates for the study.
- Passages: freeze and thaw organoids possible, smaller organoids have better recovery; give some time for cells to recover.
- Dissociate and re-aggregate: most organoids perform better when they are dissociated, better development environment.
- Growth time: organoids take time to mature, 24 hours to several weeks.
- Developmental diseases, like neurological system development diseases, are better fitted for organoids; Spheroids are better for consistent diseases, such as cancer.
- I got nothing from patient cells: start with high matrigel concentration; try multiple times.
- Brain stem cells: organoids for different parts of the brain; maturation time 2-6 weeks.
- Create as many spheroids as possible: Corning has a technology that does this.
- Small bioreactors with small shear force: need to consider if cells can withstand shear force, less uniform result.
- Organoids can discover genetic cause of disease in non-coding regions using cells from many patients.
- Two types of cultures: in air contact or in medium.
- How to evaluate: success of cystic fibrosis models, measure histological markers, use organoids to choose drug and see if drug performs well.
