## mRNA components and impact on manufacturability

- Caps: recruit transcription machinery, prevent degradation, prevent immune response
- UTRs: increase or decrease mRNA longevity
- Modified bases such as pseudouridine can be incorporated anywhere
- Longer poly-A tails tend to make the mRNA last longer, but is case-by-case

- Complex UTR sequences inhibit t7-polymerase
- Repetitive sequences lead to longer plasmid lead times
- Reduce relying on rare materials and animal-source materials

## Analytical methods

- Decide on key quality attributes and aim for those in development.

## How application affects design

- Vaccine:
	- strong immune response
	- high protein production
	- caps, UTRs, poly-A tails can be modified to fit those needs
- Gene editing: 
	- 2 RNAs
	- one for high protein production
	- one for guide RNA
- Cancer vaccine:
	- Introduce a specific target, suck as T cell receptor
	- Doesn't need to last long
- Protein replacement:
	- High yield, fast production
	- Low immune response
- Structured RNA:
	- Aptamer, specific structure, tRNA (for stop codons)
	- Structure is the most important
	- Probably do not have poly-A tails or caps
	- Modified bases

## How application affects manufacture

- Low immune response: low double-stranded RNA; can be controlled by upstream reaction
- Designing good synthesis reactions simplifies purification downstream
- Scalability is important for vaccines:
	- Purification and production rate are important

## How application guides analytical methods

- The critical metric depends on the application.
- For example, dsRNA is not as important for vaccines, and do not need to be tightly controlled.

## Future perspectives

- Integration with other types of therapies.
- Automation and solutions to manufacture challenges
