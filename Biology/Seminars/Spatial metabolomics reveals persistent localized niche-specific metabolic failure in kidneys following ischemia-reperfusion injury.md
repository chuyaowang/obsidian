# Spatial metabolomics reveals persistent localized niche-specific metabolic failure in kidneys following ischemia-reperfusion injury

#paper 

### **1. Motivation**

This study is driven by the urgent clinical challenge of acute kidney injury (AKI) and its progression to chronic kidney disease (CKD). After an ischemic event, many proximal tubule cells fail to fully repair—entering what is known as a “failed repair” (FR-PT) state. While many studies have focused on the intrinsic defects of these cells, the authors aimed to determine whether the surrounding microenvironment (or niche) also contributes to persistent metabolic failure. In other words, they wanted to know if a disrupted metabolic landscape in the tissue is interfering with successful kidney regeneration, thereby predisposing to CKD.

### **2. Research Question**

The pivotal question of the study is:  
**Does a spatially heterogeneous metabolic microenvironment around the proximal tubular cells contribute to a persistent injury signature that prevents the kidney from re-establishing metabolic homeostasis after ischemic damage?**

The study interrogates whether metabolic dysfunction is restricted to specific injured cells or whether their neighboring “healthy” cells are also influenced by a broader, niche-specific failure to recover.

### **3. Background Information**

- **Acute Kidney Injury and Repair:**  
  Previous research has demonstrated that after an ischemic insult, the kidney’s proximal tubule cells can either regenerate or adopt a FR-PT state marked by impaired metabolism. This malfunction has been linked to a shift in cellular bioenergetics—specifically, an accumulation of metabolites like succinic acid due to disrupted mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.

- **Importance of the Microenvironment:**  
  While numerous studies have focused on this cellular phenotype, less attention has been given to the tissue-wide interactions that may perpetuate injury. Insights from cancer biology and regenerative medicine underscore that the microenvironment (including cell–cell interactions, nutrient delivery, and extracellular matrix context) heavily influences cell behavior and fate.

- **Spatial Omics Developments:**  
  Advances in spatially resolved omics technologies—such as mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and spatial transcriptomics—have now made it possible to map both small-molecule metabolites and gene expression directly within their native tissue context. This allows researchers to study how local metabolic conditions correlate with repair or dysfunction in kidney tissue.

Altogether, the study builds upon these foundational ideas by merging spatial metabolomics with transcriptomics to achieve a holistic, niche-level view of the tissue’s metabolic state following injury.

### **4. Data Types and Acquisition Methods**

- **Spatial Metabolomics (qMSI):**  
  - **Data Type:** Lipid profiles, free fatty acids, succinic acid, phosphatidylserine, glutamine, and other metabolites.
  - **Acquisition:** Mouse kidney sections were prepared following a bilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (bIRI) model. A semi-quantitative mass spectrometry imaging (qMSI) protocol was used. A U‑13C-labeled yeast internal standard was sprayed onto the tissue sections to allow normalization and quantification of metabolite abundances.
  - **Outcome:** These measurements provided fine resolution data that identified the distribution and abundance of various metabolites across the kidney.

- **Spatial Transcriptomics (Stereo‑seq):**  
  - **Data Type:** Genome-wide gene expression, particularly of canonical kidney cell markers and pathways related to metabolism.
  - **Acquisition:** Consecutive kidney tissue sections were processed using high‐resolution spatial transcriptomics (Stereo‑seq), enabling the researchers to map the gene expression patterns across areas identified in the qMSI data.
  
Combining these two methods allowed for a powerful multi-layered investigation of both the metabolic and transcriptional landscapes within specific niches of the kidney.

### **5. Theoretical Framework**

- **Metabolic Reprogramming:**  
  Under ischemic conditions, lack of oxygen impairs oxidative phosphorylation, leading to the accumulation of metabolic intermediates (for example, succinic acid). This can trigger a cascade of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon reperfusion. The study leverages ideas from mitochondrial bioenergetics and metabolic reprogramming to explain how these changes might become entrenched.

- **Niche Theory in Tissue Biology:**  
  According to niche theory, the microenvironment or “niche” surrounding a cell provides cues that govern cellular behavior. In the context of kidney repair, the theory suggests that even cells that appear normal might be functionally compromised if they reside in a metabolically impaired microenvironment.

- **Systems Integration of Spatial Omics:**  
  Integrating data across different omics layers (metabolites and transcripts) supports a systems biology approach. This methodology helps to understand how metabolic states are coordinated with gene expression changes, reinforcing the idea that metabolic failure is a collective, niche-dependent phenomenon rather than an isolated cellular event.

These frameworks underpin the hypothesis that a failed metabolic niche could be as critical a target for therapeutic intervention as the individual FR-PT cells themselves.

### **6. Methods**

- **Animal Model and Tissue Collection:**  
  - Mice were subjected to a bilateral ischemia‑reperfusion injury (bIRI) to simulate acute kidney injury. Kidneys were harvested 14 days after injury, a time point chosen to capture persistent defects during the chronic phase of repair.

- **qMSI with Internal Standard:**  
  - Tissue sections were mounted on indium‑tin‑oxide (ITO) coated slides. A U‑13C‑labeled yeast internal standard was sprayed onto the tissue to enable semi‑quantitative MSI. This allowed for robust normalization and comparison of metabolite levels across different regions.
  
- **Unsupervised Clustering Using BANKSY:**  
  - The MSI data, containing about 130 lipid features per pixel, were analyzed using the BANKSY algorithm. This technique clustered pixels into 16 distinct spatial domains (niches) based on both the metabolite abundances and the local neighborhood composition.
  - Specific domains were identified as “healthy niches” (composed mostly of normal proximal tubules) and “injured niches” (characterized by an enrichment of FR-PT cells and altered lipid profiles).
  
- **Spatial Transcriptomics and Niche Projection:**  
  - A consecutive tissue section underwent spatial transcriptomics with Stereo‑seq. The authors then aligned the qMSI data with the transcriptomics data using visual landmarks (e.g., gaps in tissue) and linear transformation.
  - A nearest‑neighbor search (niche projection) was employed to map the metabolomics‑defined niches onto the transcriptomic data, allowing the researchers to evaluate gene expression differences corresponding to the metabolic niches.
  
- **Differential Analysis and Gene Set Enrichment:**  
  - Differential metabolite abundance was analyzed (using volcano plots and radial representations) to compare healthy versus injured niches.
  - For the transcriptomic data, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on proximal tubule cells from the different niches, focusing on pathways such as oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid metabolism, and intracellular communication.

### **7. Results**

- **Identification of Spatial Niches:**  
  Unsupervised clustering via BANKSY revealed several discrete spatial domains. Key among these were:
  - **Healthy Niche (HN):** Areas rich in normal proximal tubule cells.
  - **Injured Niches (IN1 and IN2):** Regions with a significant presence of FR-PT cells and a distinct metabolic signature.

- **Metabolic Findings:**  
  - **Elevated Succinic Acid in Injured Niches:** Proximal tubules within injured niches consistently showed higher succinic acid levels. This remains significant 14 days post‑injury and implies persistent mitochondrial dysfunction.
  - **Reduced Linoleic Acid and Other Lipids:** Injured niches also exhibited lower levels of free fatty acids (such as linoleic acid) and phosphatidylserine, suggesting impaired fatty acid β‑oxidation and disrupted lipid handling.
  - **Differential Metabolic Profiles:** Even when comparing similar cell types (e.g., proximal tubules in both healthy and injured niches), the metabolic profiles differed in a niche‑dependent manner.

- **Transcriptomic Corroboration:**  
  - **Downregulation of Oxidative Pathways:** Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that proximal tubule cells in the injured niches had downregulated genes related to oxidative phosphorylation, complex I biogenesis, and respiratory electron transport.
  - **Upregulation of Stress and Communication Pathways:** Other pathways—such as MAPK signaling and mRNA processing—were elevated, suggesting a cellular response to ongoing stress in these niches.

### **8. Validation Strategies**

- **Cross-modal Alignment:**  
  The researchers manually aligned consecutive tissue sections by using distinctive landmarks (e.g., gaps caused by sectioning) and confirmed the overlap by comparing areas of low RNA counts. The nearest‑neighbor algorithm further ensured that the metabolically defined niches were accurately projected onto the spatial transcriptomics maps.

- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Rigorous statistical tests (including Kruskal‑Wallis and two‑way ANOVA using Tukey’s correction) validated that the differences in metabolite abundances between healthy and injured niches were significant.

- **Concordance Between Modalities:**  
  Comparative analyses of cell-type distributions between the qMSI and Stereo‑seq results showed consistent patterns. This provided further confidence in the niche projection and the multiomic integration approach.

### **9. Implications and Clinical Relevance**

- **Understanding Metabolic Failure:**  
  The study demonstrates that even cells which appear normal by standard histological measures may be functionally compromised if they lie within an unhealthy metabolic niche. Persistent elevation of succinic acid and concomitant lipid deficits indicate that the tissue microenvironment fails to reset its metabolic balance after injury.

- **Therapeutic Targeting of the Microenvironment:**  
  The findings suggest a paradigm shift: instead of narrowly targeting the FR-PT cells, future therapies might improve kidney recovery by “resuscitating” the surrounding niche. Correcting the metabolic defects (for example, by targeting mitochondrial function or rebalancing lipid metabolism) might help overcome the barriers to full regeneration.

- **Prevention of CKD:**  
  Since impaired metabolic recovery of the kidney predisposes to chronic kidney disease, interventions designed to restore the metabolic niche have the potential to reduce long-term renal dysfunction following AKI.

- **Broader Applications:**  
  The integrated multiomic approach is not limited to kidney injury—it could be tailored to study other organs where tissue heterogeneity and microenvironmental factors play central roles in disease progression and repair.

### **10. Clinical Problem Addressed**

At its core, the study addresses the clinical problem of inadequate kidney regeneration following ischemic injury—a key factor in the progression from AKI to CKD. By elucidating how niche‑specific metabolic failure contributes to this process, the innovation offers new strategies for therapeutic intervention, emphasizing the importance of restoring metabolic homeostasis across the entire tissue microenvironment rather than focusing solely on intrinsically damaged cells.
