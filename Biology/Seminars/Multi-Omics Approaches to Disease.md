## Approaches to integrative analysis of multiple omics data

### Genome first

> Identify how GWAS loci contribute to disease.

- GWAS identifies loci that are causing diseases, which can contain multiple genes. However, it does not tell which gene or pathway is altered to identify a drug target.
- The genome first approach starts from a loci, integrates with additional omic layers, and identifies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or genes that are directly related to diseases.
- There are databases of eQTLs for various tissues of animals and human

> [!info] Cause of Genetic Diseases
> Many genetic diseases are not explained by variation in the coding regions of the genome but the non-coding regions that regulate gene expression.
> 
> Transcriptomics can be used to find transcripts that have different expression levels and locate the corresponding loci that caused the expression level change.

> [!note] Examine Causality of eQTLs
> A number of statistical methods have been developed for examining causality based on eQTL at GWAS loci, including **conditional analysis** and **mediation analysis**.

### Phenotype first

Understand the pathways contributing to a disease without centering on a particular locus.

### Environment first

Investigate how the environment perturbs pathways or interacts with genetic variation.
