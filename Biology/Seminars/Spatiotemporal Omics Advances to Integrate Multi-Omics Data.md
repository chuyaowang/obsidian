## Applications

Mulder: Molecular resolution important for neuroscience. Look at many molecules at the same time.

Poo: 
- spatial technology differentiates cell types in the neural network with spatial information, spatial distribution. Fluorescence tracing,  trace exon structure, elucidate neural network. 
- Brains of mice, vertebrates, primates have been studied in detail. 
- Map regulatory elements in various cell types.

Mulder:
- How cells communicate with each other in disease, like AD (neuronal cells), cancer (immune cells).
- Problem: how the disease starts; important for prevention and treatment.

Esteban:
- Embryonic development.
- Development can be a very fast process.

Summary: Studying development and regeneration, cell communication in disease and cell culture.

## Stereo-seq

- Large chip
- Combination with other types of data, like protein, single cell, imaging.

Important to combine multi-omics data to study development. What proteins are actually translated during organism growth? 

Interaction network of cells with other cells, proteins with other proteins.

Temporal resolution of transcriptomics.

## Will AI help

- Use of computational methods to help with data analysis
	- Tissue section labeling
	- Semi-automatic labeling, machine learning with human supervision
- The amount of data is large. Data mining.
	- Data sharing is critical

## Q&A

- Future of transcriptomics: will be very important
	- Amount of data will be more and more as data acquisition becomes easier.
- Clinical use: in clinical settings, reproducibility and arriving at clear answers are critical. Cell-cell interactions reveals pathogenesis mechanism.
