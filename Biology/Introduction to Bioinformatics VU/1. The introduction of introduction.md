# Introduction

## Sequencing data analyses flow

1. Images: read color of the dots to identify A, T, G, or C
2. Reads
3. Aligned reads
4. Called variants, SNPs, SNVs

## What can we measure

- levels of molecules/variants in cells
- also called omics data
- molecular profiling
- huge number of measurements per sample

## What you should know

- ML
- Statistics
- Sequence analysis methods
- Domain knowledge in biomedicine and molecular biology
